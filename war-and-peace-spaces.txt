LONG CONVERSATION WITH SPERANSKI ONLY STRENGTHENED IN PRINCEANDREW THE FEELING HE HAD EXPERIENCED TOWARD HIM AT THEIR FIRST MEETINGHE SAW IN HIM A REMARKABLE CLEARTHINKING MAN OF VAST INTELLECT WHO BYHIS ENERGY AND PERSISTENCE HAD ATTAINED POWER WHICH HE WAS USING SOLELYFOR THE WELFARE OF RUSSIA IN PRINCE ANDREWS EYES SPERANSKI WAS THE MANHE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE WISHED TO BEONE WHO EXPLAINED ALL THE FACTS OFLIFE REASONABLY CONSIDERED IMPORTANT ONLY WHAT WAS RATIONAL AND WASCAPABLE OF APPLYING THE STANDARD OF REASON TO EVERYTHING EVERYTHINGSEEMED SO SIMPLE AND CLEAR IN SPERANSKIS EXPOSITION THAT PRINCE ANDREWINVOLUNTARILY AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT EVERYTHING IF HE REPLIED ANDARGUED IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO MAINTAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE ANDNOT SUBMIT TO SPERANSKIS OPINIONS ENTIRELY EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT ANDEVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE ONLY ONE THING DISCONCERTED PRINCEANDREW THIS WAS SPERANSKIS COLD MIRRORLIKE LOOK WHICH DID NOT ALLOWONE TO PENETRATE TO HIS SOUL AND HIS DELICATE WHITE HANDS WHICH PRINCEANDREW INVOLUNTARILY WATCHED AS ONE DOES WATCH THE HANDS OF THOSE WHOPOSSESS POWER THIS MIRRORLIKE GAZE AND THOSE DELICATE HANDS IRRITATEDPRINCE ANDREW HE KNEW NOT WHY HE WAS UNPLEASANTLY STRUCK TOO BY THEEXCESSIVE CONTEMPT FOR OTHERS THAT HE OBSERVED IN SPERANSKI AND BY THEDIVERSITY OF LINES OF ARGUMENT HE USED TO SUPPORT HIS OPINIONS HE MADEUSE OF EVERY KIND OF MENTAL DEVICE EXCEPT ANALOGY AND PASSED TOOBOLDLY IT SEEMED TO PRINCE ANDREW FROM ONE TO ANOTHER NOW HE WOULDTAKE UP THE POSITION OF A PRACTICAL MAN AND CONDEMN DREAMERS NOW THATOF A SATIRIST AND LAUGH IRONICALLY AT HIS OPPONENTS NOW GROW SEVERELYLOGICAL OR SUDDENLY RISE TO THE REALM OF METAPHYSICS THIS LASTRESOURCE WAS ONE HE VERY FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED HE WOULD TRANSFER AQUESTION TO METAPHYSICAL HEIGHTS PASS ON TO DEFINITIONS OF SPACE TIMEAND THOUGHT AND HAVING DEDUCED THE REFUTATION HE NEEDED WOULD AGAINDESCEND TO THE LEVEL OF THE ORIGINAL DISCUSSIONIN GENERAL THE TRAIT OF SPERANSKIS MENTALITY WHICH STRUCK PRINCE ANDREWMOST WAS HIS ABSOLUTE AND UNSHAKABLE BELIEF IN THE POWER AND AUTHORITYOF REASON IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE THOUGHT COULD NEVER OCCUR TO HIMWHICH TO PRINCE ANDREW SEEMED SO NATURAL NAMELY THAT IT IS AFTER ALLIMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS ALL ONE THINKS AND THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT THEDOUBT IS NOT ALL I THINK AND BELIEVE NONSENSE AND IT WAS JUST THISPECULIARITY OF SPERANSKIS MIND THAT PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED PRINCEANDREWDURING THE FIRST PERIOD OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BOLKONSKI FELT APASSIONATE ADMIRATION FOR HIM SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HE HAD ONCE FELT FORBONAPARTE THE FACT THAT SPERANSKI WAS THE SON OF A VILLAGE PRIEST ANDTHAT STUPID PEOPLE MIGHT MEANLY DESPISE HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HUMBLEORIGIN AS IN FACT MANY DID CAUSED PRINCE ANDREW TO CHERISH HISSENTIMENT FOR HIM THE MORE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY TO STRENGTHEN ITON THAT FIRST EVENING BOLKONSKI SPENT WITH HIM HAVING MENTIONED THECOMMISSION FOR THE REVISION OF THE CODE OF LAWS SPERANSKI TOLD HIMSARCASTICALLY THAT THE COMMISSION HAD EXISTED FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTYYEARS HAD COST MILLIONS AND HAD DONE NOTHING EXCEPT THAT ROSENKAMPFHAD STUCK LABELS ON THE CORRESPONDING PARAGRAPHS OF THE DIFFERENT CODESAND THAT IS ALL THE STATE HAS FOR THE MILLIONS IT HAS SPENT SAID HEWE WANT TO GIVE THE SENATE NEW JURIDICAL POWERS BUT WE HAVE NO LAWSTHAT IS WHY IT IS A SIN FOR MEN LIKE YOU PRINCE NOT TO SERVE IN THESETIMESPRINCE ANDREW SAID THAT FOR THAT WORK AN EDUCATION IN JURISPRUDENCE WASNEEDED WHICH HE DID NOT POSSESSBUT NOBODY POSSESSES IT SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLEFROM WHICH WE MUST BREAK A WAY OUTA WEEK LATER PRINCE ANDREW WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON ARMYREGULATIONS ANDWHAT HE HAD NOT AT ALL EXPECTEDWAS CHAIRMAN OF ASECTION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE REVISION OF THE LAWS AT SPERANSKISREQUEST HE TOOK THE FIRST PART OF THE CIVIL CODE THAT WAS BEING DRAWN UPAND WITH THE AID OF THE CODE NAPOLEON AND THE INSTITUTES OF JUSTINIANHE WORKED AT FORMULATING THE SECTION ON PERSONAL

THEBACHELOR CIRCLES IN WHICH HE MOVEDAMID THE TURMOIL OF HIS ACTIVITIES AND DISTRACTIONS HOWEVER PIERRE ATTHE END OF A YEAR BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MORE FIRMLY HE TRIED TO RESTUPON IT THE MORE MASONIC GROUND ON WHICH HE STOOD GAVE WAY UNDER HIMAT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT THE DEEPER THE GROUND SANK UNDER HIM THECLOSER BOUND HE INVOLUNTARILY BECAME TO THE ORDER WHEN HE HAD JOINEDTHE FREEMASONS HE

ALMOST ENTIRELY INMOSCOW ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE LODGES WERE MEN PIERRE KNEW IN ORDINARYLIFE AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REGARD THEM MERELY AS BROTHERS INFREEMASONRY AND NOT AS PRINCE B OR IVAN VASILEVICH D WHOM HE KNEW INSOCIETY MOSTLY AS WEAK AND INSIGNIFICANT MEN UNDER THE MASONIC APRONSAND INSIGNIA HE SAW THE UNIFORMS AND DECORATIONS AT WHICH THEY AIMED INORDINARY LIFE OFTEN AFTER

PIERRE RECKONED HIMSELF AND OTHERS LIKE HIMSEEKING AND VACILLATING WHO HAD NOT YET FOUND IN FREEMASONRY A STRAIGHTAND COMPREHENSIBLE PATH BUT HOPED TO DO SOIN THE THIRD CATEGORY HE INCLUDED THOSE BROTHERS THE MAJORITY WHO SAWNOTHING IN FREEMASONRY BUT THE EXTERNAL FORMS AND CEREMONIES AND PRIZEDTHE STRICT PERFORMANCE OF THESE FORMS WITHOUT TROUBLING ABOUT THEIRPURPORT OR SIGNIFICANCE SUCH WERE WILLARSKI AND EVEN THE GRAND MASTEROF THE PRINCIPAL LODGEFINALLY TO THE FOURTH CATEGORY ALSO A GREAT MANY BROTHERS BELONGEDPARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD LATELY JOINED THESE ACCORDING TO PIERRESOBSERVATIONS WERE MEN WHO HAD NO BELIEF IN ANYTHING NOR DESIRE FORANYTHING BUT JOINED THE FREEMASONS MERELY TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE WEALTHYYOUNG BROTHERS WHO WERE INFLUENTIAL THROUGH THEIR CONNECTIONS OR RANKAND OF WHOM THERE WERE VERY MANY IN THE LODGEPIERRE BEGAN TO FEEL DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING FREEMASONRYAT ANY RATE AS HE SAW IT HERE SOMETIMES SEEMED TO HIM BASED MERELY ONEXTERNALS HE DID NOT THINK OF DOUBTING FREEMASONRY ITSELF BUTSUSPECTED THAT RUSSIAN MASONRY HAD TAKEN A WRONG PATH AND DEVIATED FROMITS ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES AND SO TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR HE WENTABROAD TO BE INITIATED INTO THE HIGHER SECRETS OF THE ORDERIN THE SUMMER OF  PIERRE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG OUR FREEMASONS KNEWFROM CORRESPONDENCE WITH THOSE ABROAD THAT BEZUKHOV HAD OBTAINED THECONFIDENCE OF MANY HIGHLY PLACED PERSONS HAD BEEN INITIATED INTO MANYMYSTERIES HAD BEEN RAISED TO A HIGHER GRADE AND WAS BRINGING BACK WITHHIM MUCH THAT MIGHT CONDUCE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MASONIC CAUSE INRUSSIA THE PETERSBURG FREEMASONS ALL CAME TO SEE HIM TRIED TOINGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH HIM AND IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL THAT HE WASPREPARING SOMETHING FOR THEM AND CONCEALING ITA SOLEMN MEETING OF THE LODGE OF THE SECOND DEGREE WAS CONVENED ATWHICH PIERRE PROMISED TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PETERSBURG BROTHERS WHAT HEHAD TO DELIVER TO THEM FROM THE HIGHEST LEADERS OF THEIR ORDER THEMEETING WAS A FULL ONE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES PIERRE ROSE AND BEGANHIS ADDRESSDEAR BROTHERS HE BEGAN BLUSHING AND STAMMERING WITH A WRITTENSPEECH IN HIS HAND IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO OBSERVE OUR

A PREPONDERANCE OF VIRTUE OVER VICEAND MUST ENDEAVOR TO SECURE THAT THE HONEST MAN MAY EVEN IN THIS WORLDRECEIVE A LASTING REWARD FOR HIS VIRTUE BUT IN THESE GREAT ENDEAVORS WEARE GRAVELY HAMPERED BY THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF TODAY WHAT IS TOBE DONE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOR REVOLUTIONS OVERTHROWEVERYTHING REPEL FORCE BY FORCE NO WE ARE VERY FAR FROM THATEVERY VIOLENT REFORM DESERVES

MASTER WITH IRONY AND ILLWILLREPROVED BEZUKHOV FOR HIS VEHEMENCE AND SAID IT WAS NOT LOVE OF VIRTUEALONE BUT ALSO A LOVE OF STRIFE THAT HAD MOVED HIM IN THE DISPUTEPIERRE DID NOT ANSWER HIM AND ASKED BRIEFLY WHETHER HIS PROPOSAL WOULDBE ACCEPTED HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD NOT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR THEUSUAL FORMALITIES HE LEFT THE LODGE AND WENT HOMECHAPTER VIIIAGAIN PIERRE WAS OVERTAKEN BY THE DEPRESSION HE SO DREADED FOR THREEDAYS AFTER THE DELIVERY OF HIS SPEECH AT THE LODGE HE LAY ON A SOFA ATHOME RECEIVING NO ONE AND GOING NOWHEREIT WAS JUST THEN THAT HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE

PETERSBURG FROM ABROADFOLLOWING THIS LETTER ONE OF THE MASONIC BROTHERS WHOM PIERRE RESPECTEDLESS THAN THE OTHERS FORCED HIS WAY IN TO SEE HIM AND TURNING THECONVERSATION UPON PIERRES MATRIMONIAL

ONLY AT BALD HILLS IN THE WHOLE WORLD IT SEEMS IS NOTACCEPTED AS A GREAT MAN STILL LESS AS EMPEROR OF FRANCE AND MY FATHERCANNOT STAND THIS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF HISPOLITICAL VIEWS THAT MY FATHER IS RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OF GOING TO MOSCOWFOR HE FORESEES THE ENCOUNTERS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM HIS WAY OFEXPRESSING HIS VIEWS REGARDLESS OF ANYBODY ALL THE BENEFIT HE MIGHTDERIVE

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY AT THE END OFJUNE THE FIRST ARMY WITH WHICH WAS THE EMPEROR OCCUPIED THE FORTIFIEDCAMP AT DRISSA THE SECOND ARMY WAS RETREATING TRYING TO EFFECT AJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST ONE FROM WHICH IT WAS SAID TO BE CUT OFF BYLARGE FRENCH FORCES EVERYONE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE GENERAL COURSEOF AFFAIRS IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY BUT NO ONE ANTICIPATED ANY DANGER OFINVASION OF THE RUSSIAN PROVINCES AND NO ONE THOUGHT THE WAR WOULDEXTEND FARTHER THAN THE WESTERN THE POLISH PROVINCESPRINCE ANDREW FOUND BARCLAY DE TOLLY TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED ONTHE BANK OF THE DRISSA AS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE TOWN OR LARGE VILLAGEIN THE VICINITY OF THE CAMP THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF GENERALS ANDCOURTIERS ACCOMPANYING THE ARMY WERE LIVING IN THE BEST HOUSES OF THEVILLAGES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER

EMPEROR FOR A DECISION AS TO HIS EMPLOYMENTBUT ASKED HIM MEANWHILE TO REMAIN ON HIS STAFF ANATOLE KURAGIN WHOMPRINCE ANDREW HAD HOPED TO FIND WITH THE ARMY WAS NOT THERE HE HADGONE TO PETERSBURG BUT PRINCE ANDREW WAS GLAD TO HEAR THIS HIS MINDWAS OCCUPIED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE CENTER THAT WAS CONDUCTING AGIGANTIC WAR AND HE WAS GLAD TO BE FREE FOR A WHILE FROM THEDISTRACTION CAUSED BY THE THOUGHT OF KURAGIN DURING THE FIRST FOURDAYS WHILE NO DUTIES WERE REQUIRED OF HIM PRINCE ANDREW RODE ROUND THEWHOLE FORTIFIED CAMP AND BY THE AID OF HIS OWN KNOWLEDGE AND BY TALKSWITH EXPERTS TRIED TO FORM A DEFINITE OPINION ABOUT IT BUT THEQUESTION WHETHER THE CAMP WAS ADVANTAGEOUS OR DISADVANTAGEOUS REMAINEDFOR HIM UNDECIDED ALREADY FROM HIS MILITARY EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HE HADSEEN IN THE AUSTRIAN CAMPAIGN HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN WARTHE MOST DEEPLY CONSIDERED PLANS HAVE NO SIGNIFICANCE AND THAT ALLDEPENDS ON THE WAY UNEXPECTED MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMYTHAT CANNOT BEFORESEENARE MET AND ON HOW AND BY WHOM THE WHOLE MATTER IS HANDLEDTO CLEAR UP THIS LAST POINT FOR HIMSELF PRINCE ANDREW UTILIZING HISPOSITION AND ACQUAINTANCES TRIED TO FATHOM THE CHARACTER OF THE CONTROLOF THE ARMY AND OF THE MEN AND PARTIES ENGAGED IN IT AND HE DEDUCED FORHIMSELF THE FOLLOWING OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRSWHILE THE EMPEROR HAD STILL BEEN AT VILNA THE FORCES HAD BEEN DIVIDEDINTO THREE ARMIES FIRST THE

ALEXANDERPAULUCCI WAS THERE BECAUSE HE WAS BOLD AND DECIDED IN SPEECH THEADJUTANTS GENERAL WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED THEEMPEROR AND LASTLY AND CHIEFLY PFUEL WAS THERE BECAUSE HE HAD

PFUEL AND HIS ADHERENTS DEMANDEDA RETIREMENT INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTRY IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRECISELAWS DEFINED BY A PSEUDOTHEORY OF WAR AND THEY SAW ONLY BARBARISMIGNORANCE OR EVIL INTENTION IN EVERY DEVIATION FROM THAT THEORY TOTHIS PARTY BELONGED THE FOREIGN NOBLES WOLZOGEN WINTZINGERODE ANDOTHERS CHIEFLY GERMANSTHE SECOND PARTY WAS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE FIRST ONE EXTREME ASALWAYS HAPPENS WAS MET BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER THE MEMBERS OFTHIS PARTY WERE THOSE WHO HAD DEMANDED AN ADVANCE FROM VILNA INTO POLANDAND FREEDOM FROM ALL PREARRANGED PLANS BESIDES BEING ADVOCATES OF BOLDACTION THIS SECTION ALSO REPRESENTED NATIONALISM WHICH MADE THEM STILLMORE ONESIDED IN THE DISPUTE THEY WERE RUSSIANS BAGRATION ERMOLOVWHO WAS BEGINNING TO COME TO THE FRONT AND OTHERS AT THAT TIME AFAMOUS JOKE OF ERMOLOVS WAS BEING CIRCULATED THAT AS A GREAT FAVOR HEHAD PETITIONED THE EMPEROR TO MAKE HIM A GERMAN THE MEN OF THAT PARTYREMEMBERING SUVOROV SAID THAT WHAT ONE HAD TO DO WAS NOT TO REASON ORSTICK PINS INTO MAPS BUT TO FIGHT BEAT THE ENEMY KEEP HIM OUT OFRUSSIA AND NOT LET THE ARMY GET DISCOURAGEDTO THE THIRD PARTYIN WHICH THE EMPEROR HAD MOST CONFIDENCEBELONGEDTHE COURTIERS WHO TRIED TO ARRANGE COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWOTHE MEMBERS OF THIS PARTY CHIEFLY CIVILIANS AND TO WHOM ARAKCHEEVBELONGED THOUGHT AND SAID WHAT MEN WHO HAVE NO CONVICTIONS BUT WISH TOSEEM TO HAVE SOME GENERALLY SAY THEY SAID THAT UNDOUBTEDLY WARPARTICULARLY AGAINST SUCH A GENIUS AS BONAPARTE THEY CALLED HIMBONAPARTE NOW NEEDS MOST DEEPLY DEVISED PLANS AND PROFOUND SCIENTIFICKNOWLEDGE AND IN THAT RESPECT PFUEL WAS A GENIUS BUT AT THE SAME TIMEIT HAD TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE THEORISTS ARE OFTEN ONESIDED ANDTHEREFORE ONE SHOULD NOT TRUST THEM ABSOLUTELY BUT SHOULD ALSO LISTENTO WHAT PFUELS OPPONENTS AND PRACTICAL MEN OF EXPERIENCE IN WARFARE HADTO SAY AND THEN CHOOSE A MIDDLE COURSE THEY INSISTED ON THE RETENTIONOF THE CAMP AT DRISSA ACCORDING TO PFUELS PLAN BUT ON CHANGING THEMOVEMENTS OF THE OTHER ARMIES THOUGH BY THIS COURSE NEITHER ONE AIMNOR THE OTHER COULD BE ATTAINED YET IT SEEMED BEST TO THE ADHERENTS OFTHIS THIRD PARTYOF A FOURTH OPINION THE MOST CONSPICUOUS

CHILDISHNESSHE WENT UP TO THE MAP AND SPEAKING RAPIDLY BEGAN PROVING THAT NOEVENTUALITY COULD ALTER THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DRISSA CAMP THATEVERYTHING HAD BEEN FORESEEN AND THAT IF THE ENEMY WERE REALLY GOING TOOUTFLANK IT THE ENEMY WOULD INEVITABLY BE DESTROYEDPAULUCCI WHO DID NOT KNOW GERMAN BEGAN QUESTIONING HIM IN FRENCHWOLZOGEN CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS CHIEF WHO SPOKE FRENCH BADLYAND BEGAN TRANSLATING FOR HIM HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH PFUEL WHOWAS RAPIDLY DEMONSTRATING THAT NOT ONLY ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BUT ALLTHAT COULD HAPPEN HAD BEEN FORESEEN IN HIS SCHEME AND THAT IF THEREWERE NOW ANY DIFFICULTIES THE WHOLE FAULT LAY IN THE FACT THAT HIS PLANHAD NOT BEEN PRECISELY EXECUTED HE KEPT LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY HEDEMONSTRATED AND AT LAST CONTEMPTUOUSLY CEASED TO DEMONSTRATE LIKE AMATHEMATICIAN WHO CEASES TO PROVE IN VARIOUS WAYS THE ACCURACY OF APROBLEM THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVED WOLZOGEN TOOK HIS PLACE ANDCONTINUED TO EXPLAIN HIS VIEWS IN FRENCH EVERY NOW AND THEN TURNING

THESE MEN PRINCE ANDREW SYMPATHIZED MOST WITH PFUEL ANGRYDETERMINED AND ABSURDLY SELFCONFIDENT AS HE WAS OF ALL THOSE PRESENTEVIDENTLY HE ALONE WAS NOT SEEKING ANYTHING FOR HIMSELF NURSED NOHATRED AGAINST ANYONE AND ONLY DESIRED THAT THE PLAN FORMED ON ATHEORY ARRIVED AT BY YEARS OF TOIL SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT HE WASRIDICULOUS AND UNPLEASANTLY SARCASTIC BUT YET HE INSPIRED INVOLUNTARYRESPECT BY HIS BOUNDLESS DEVOTION TO AN IDEA BESIDES THIS THE REMARKSOF ALL EXCEPT PFUEL HAD ONE COMMON TRAIT THAT HAD NOT BEEN NOTICEABLE ATTHE COUNCIL OF WAR IN  THERE WAS NOW A PANIC FEAR OF NAPOLEONSGENIUS WHICH THOUGH CONCEALED WAS NOTICEABLE IN EVERY REJOINDEREVERYTHING WAS ASSUMED TO BE POSSIBLE FOR NAPOLEON THEY EXPECTED HIMFROM EVERY SIDE AND INVOKED HIS TERRIBLE NAME TO SHATTER EACH OTHERSPROPOSALS PFUEL ALONE SEEMED TO CONSIDER NAPOLEON A BARBARIAN LIKEEVERYONE ELSE WHO OPPOSED HIS THEORY BUT BESIDES THIS FEELING OFRESPECT PFUEL EVOKED PITY IN PRINCE ANDREW FROM THE TONE IN WHICH THECOURTIERS ADDRESSED HIM AND THE WAY PAULUCCI HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TOSPEAK OF HIM TO THE EMPEROR BUT ABOVE ALL FROM A CERTAIN DESPERATION INPFUELS OWN EXPRESSIONS IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE OTHERS KNEW AND PFUELHIMSELF FELT THAT HIS FALL WAS AT HAND AND DESPITE HIS SELFCONFIDENCEAND GRUMPY GERMAN SARCASM HE WAS PITIABLE WITH HIS HAIR SMOOTHLYBRUSHED ON THE TEMPLES AND STICKING UP IN TUFTS BEHIND THOUGH HECONCEALED THE FACT UNDER A SHOW OF IRRITATION AND CONTEMPT HE WASEVIDENTLY IN DESPAIR THAT THE SOLE REMAINING CHANCE OF VERIFYING HISTHEORY BY A HUGE EXPERIMENT AND PROVING ITS SOUNDNESS TO THE WHOLE WORLDWAS SLIPPING AWAY FROM HIMTHE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUED A LONG TIME AND THE LONGER THEY LASTED THEMORE HEATED BECAME THE DISPUTES CULMINATING IN SHOUTS ANDPERSONALITIES AND THE LESS WAS IT POSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT ANY GENERALCONCLUSION FROM ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID PRINCE ANDREW LISTENING TO THISPOLYGLOT TALK AND TO THESE SURMISES PLANS REFUTATIONS AND SHOUTSFELT NOTHING BUT AMAZEMENT AT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING A THOUGHT THAT HADLONG SINCE AND OFTEN OCCURRED TO HIM DURING HIS MILITARY ACTIVITIESTHEIDEA THAT THERE IS NOT AND CANNOT BE ANY SCIENCE OF WAR AND THATTHEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS A MILITARY GENIUSNOW APPEAREDTO HIM AN OBVIOUS TRUTH WHAT THEORY AND SCIENCE IS POSSIBLE ABOUT AMATTER THE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH ARE UNKNOWN AND CANNOTBE DEFINED ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STRENGTH OF THE ACTING FORCES CANNOT BEASCERTAINED NO ONE WAS OR IS ABLE TO FORESEE IN WHAT CONDITION OUR ORTHE ENEMYS ARMIES WILL BE IN A DAYS TIME AND NO ONE CAN GAUGE THEFORCE OF THIS OR THAT DETACHMENT SOMETIMESWHEN THERE IS NOT A COWARDAT THE FRONT TO SHOUT WE ARE CUT OFF AND START RUNNING BUT A BRAVEAND JOLLY LAD WHO SHOUTS HURRAHA DETACHMENT OF FIVE THOUSAND ISWORTH THIRTY THOUSAND AS AT SCHON GRABERN WHILE AT TIMES FIFTYTHOUSAND RUN FROM EIGHT THOUSAND AS AT AUSTERLITZ WHAT SCIENCE CANTHERE BE IN A MATTER IN WHICH AS IN ALL PRACTICAL MATTERS NOTHING CANBE DEFINED AND EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON INNUMERABLE CONDITIONS THESIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT WHICH ARRIVESNO ONE KNOWS WHEN ARMFELDT SAYS OUR ARMY IS CUT IN HALF AND PAULUCCISAYS WE HAVE GOT THE FRENCH ARMY BETWEEN TWO FIRES MICHAUD SAYS THATTHE WORTHLESSNESS OF THE DRISSA CAMP LIES IN HAVING THE RIVER BEHIND ITAND PFUEL SAYS THAT IS WHAT CONSTITUTES ITS STRENGTH TOLL PROPOSES ONEPLAN ARMFELDT ANOTHER AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD AND ALL BAD AND THEADVANTAGES OF ANY SUGGESTIONS CAN BE SEEN ONLY AT THE MOMENT OF TRIALAND WHY DO THEY ALL SPEAK OF A MILITARY GENIUS IS A MAN A GENIUS WHOCAN ORDER BREAD TO BE BROUGHT UP AT THE RIGHT TIME AND SAY WHO IS TO GOTO THE RIGHT AND WHO TO THE LEFT IT IS ONLY BECAUSE MILITARY MEN AREINVESTED WITH POMP AND POWER AND CROWDS OF SYCHOPHANTS FLATTER POWERATTRIBUTING TO IT QUALITIES OF GENIUS IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE BESTGENERALS I HAVE KNOWN WERE ON THE CONTRARY STUPID OR ABSENTMINDEDMEN BAGRATION WAS THE BEST NAPOLEON HIMSELF ADMITTED THAT AND OFBONAPARTE HIMSELF I REMEMBER HIS LIMITED SELFSATISFIED FACE ON THEFIELD OF AUSTERLITZ NOT ONLY DOES A GOOD ARMY COMMANDER NOT NEED ANYSPECIAL QUALITIES ON THE CONTRARY HE NEEDS THE ABSENCE OF THE HIGHESTAND BEST HUMAN ATTRIBUTESLOVE POETRY TENDERNESS AND PHILOSOPHICINQUIRING DOUBT HE SHOULD BE LIMITED FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT WHAT HE ISDOING IS VERY IMPORTANT OTHERWISE HE WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENTPATIENCE AND ONLY THEN WILL HE BE A BRAVE LEADER GOD FORBID THAT HESHOULD BE HUMANE SHOULD LOVE OR PITY OR THINK OF WHAT IS JUST ANDUNJUST IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT A THEORY OF THEIR GENIUS WASINVENTED FOR THEM LONG AGO BECAUSE THEY HAVE POWER THE SUCCESS OF AMILITARY ACTION DEPENDS NOT ON THEM BUT ON THE MAN IN THE RANKS WHOSHOUTS WE ARE LOST OR WHO SHOUTS HURRAH AND ONLY IN THE RANKSCAN ONE SERVE WITH ASSURANCE OF BEING USEFULSO THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW AS HE LISTENED TO THE TALKING AND HE ROUSEDHIMSELF ONLY WHEN PAULUCCI CALLED HIM AND EVERYONE WAS LEAVINGAT THE REVIEW NEXT DAY THE EMPEROR ASKED PRINCE ANDREW WHERE HE WOULDLIKE TO SERVE AND PRINCE ANDREW LOST HIS STANDING IN COURT CIRCLESFOREVER BY NOT ASKING TO REMAIN ATTACHED TO THE SOVEREIGNS PERSON BUTFOR PERMISSION TO SERVE IN THE ARMYCHAPTER XIIBEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN ROSTOV HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROMHIS PARENTS IN WHICH THEY TOLD HIM BRIEFLY OF NATASHAS ILLNESS AND THEBREAKING OFF OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO PRINCE ANDREW WHICH THEY EXPLAINED BYNATASHAS HAVING REJECTED HIM AND AGAIN ASKED NICHOLAS TO RETIRE FROMTHE ARMY AND RETURN HOME ON RECEIVING THIS LETTER NICHOLAS DID NOTEVEN MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO GET LEAVE OF ABSENCE OR TO RETIRE FROM THEARMY BUT WROTE TO HIS PARENTS THAT HE WAS SORRY NATASHA WAS ILL AND HERENGAGEMENT BROKEN OFF AND THAT HE WOULD DO ALL HE COULD TO MEET THEIRWISHES TO SONYA HE WROTE SEPARATELYADORED FRIEND OF MY SOUL HE WROTE NOTHING BUT HONOR COULD KEEP MEFROM RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY BUT NOW AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THECAMPAIGN I SHOULD FEEL DISHONORED NOT ONLY IN MY COMRADES EYES BUT INMY OWN IF I PREFERRED MY OWN HAPPINESS TO MY LOVE AND DUTY TO THEFATHERLAND BUT THIS SHALL BE OUR LAST SEPARATION BELIEVE ME DIRECTLYTHE WAR IS OVER IF I AM STILL ALIVE AND STILL LOVED BY YOU I WILLTHROW UP EVERYTHING AND FLY TO YOU TO PRESS YOU FOREVER TO MY ARDENTBREASTIT WAS IN FACT ONLY THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT PREVENTEDROSTOV FROM RETURNING HOME AS HE HAD PROMISED AND MARRYING SONYA THEAUTUMN IN OTRADNOE WITH THE HUNTING AND THE WINTER WITH THE CHRISTMASHOLIDAYS AND SONYAS LOVE HAD OPENED OUT TO HIM A VISTA OF TRANQUILRURAL JOYS AND PEACE SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE AND WHICH NOWALLURED HIM A SPLENDID WIFE CHILDREN A GOOD PACK OF HOUNDS A DOZENLEASHES OF SMART BORZOIS AGRICULTURE NEIGHBORS SERVICE BYELECTION THOUGHT HE BUT NOW THE CAMPAIGN WAS BEGINNING AND HE HADTO REMAIN WITH HIS REGIMENT AND SINCE IT HAD TO BE SO NICHOLAS ROSTOVAS WAS NATURAL TO HIM FELT CONTENTED WITH THE LIFE HE LED IN THEREGIMENT AND WAS ABLE TO FIND PLEASURE IN THAT LIFEON HIS RETURN FROM HIS FURLOUGH NICHOLAS HAVING BEEN JOYFULLY WELCOMEDBY HIS COMRADES WAS SENT TO OBTAIN REMOUNTS AND BROUGHT BACK FROM THEUKRAINE EXCELLENT HORSES WHICH PLEASED HIM AND EARNED HIM COMMENDATIONFROM HIS COMMANDERS DURING HIS ABSENCE HE HAD BEEN PROMOTED CAPTAINAND WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS PUT ON WAR FOOTING WITH AN INCREASE INNUMBERS HE WAS AGAIN ALLOTTED HIS OLD SQUADRONTHE CAMPAIGN BEGAN THE REGIMENT WAS MOVED INTO POLAND ON DOUBLE PAYNEW OFFICERS ARRIVED NEW MEN AND HORSES AND ABOVE ALL EVERYBODY WASINFECTED WITH THE MERRILY EXCITED MOOD THAT GOES WITH THE COMMENCEMENTOF A WAR AND ROSTOV CONSCIOUS OF HIS ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION IN THEREGIMENT DEVOTED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE PLEASURES AND INTERESTS OFMILITARY SERVICE THOUGH HE KNEW THAT SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD HAVE TORELINQUISH THEMTHE TROOPS RETIRED FROM VILNA FOR VARIOUS COMPLICATED REASONS OF STATEPOLITICAL AND STRATEGIC EACH STEP OF THE RETREAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ACOMPLICATED INTERPLAY OF INTERESTS ARGUMENTS AND PASSIONS ATHEADQUARTERS FOR THE PAVLOGRAD HUSSARS HOWEVER THE WHOLE OF THISRETREAT DURING THE FINEST PERIOD OF SUMMER AND WITH SUFFICIENT SUPPLIESWAS A VERY SIMPLE AND AGREEABLE BUSINESSIT WAS ONLY AT HEADQUARTERS THAT THERE WAS DEPRESSION UNEASINESS ANDINTRIGUING IN THE BODY OF THE ARMY THEY DID NOT ASK THEMSELVES WHERETHEY WERE GOING OR WHY IF THEY REGRETTED HAVING TO RETREAT IT WAS ONLYBECAUSE THEY HAD TO LEAVE BILLETS THEY HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO OR SOMEPRETTY YOUNG POLISH LADY IF THE THOUGHT THAT THINGS LOOKED BAD CHANCEDTO ENTER ANYONES HEAD HE TRIED TO BE AS CHEERFUL AS BEFITS A GOODSOLDIER AND NOT TO THINK OF THE GENERAL TREND OF AFFAIRS BUT ONLY OFTHE TASK NEAREST TO HAND FIRST THEY CAMPED GAILY BEFORE VILNA MAKINGACQUAINTANCE WITH THE POLISH LANDOWNERS PREPARING FOR REVIEWS AND BEINGREVIEWED BY THE EMPEROR AND OTHER HIGH COMMANDERS THEN CAME AN ORDER TORETREAT TO SVENTSYANI AND DESTROY ANY PROVISIONS THEY COULD NOT CARRYAWAY WITH THEM SVENTSYANI WAS REMEMBERED BY THE HUSSARS ONLY AS THEDRUNKEN CAMP A NAME THE WHOLE ARMY GAVE TO THEIR ENCAMPMENT THERE ANDBECAUSE MANY COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE TROOPS WHO TAKINGADVANTAGE OF THE ORDER TO COLLECT PROVISIONS TOOK ALSO HORSESCARRIAGES AND CARPETS FROM THE POLISH PROPRIETORS ROSTOV REMEMBEREDSVENTSYANI BECAUSE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT THAT SMALL TOWNHE CHANGED HIS SERGEANT MAJOR AND WAS UNABLE TO MANAGE ALL THE DRUNKENMEN OF HIS SQUADRON WHO UNKNOWN TO HIM HAD APPROPRIATED FIVE BARRELSOF OLD BEER FROM SVENTSYANI THEY RETIRED FARTHER AND FARTHER TO DRISSAAND THENCE AGAIN BEYOND DRISSA DRAWING NEAR TO THE FRONTIER OF RUSSIAPROPERON THE THIRTEENTH OF JULY THE PAVLOGRADS TOOK PART IN A SERIOUS ACTIONFOR THE FIRST TIMEON THE TWELFTH OF JULY ON THE EVE OF THAT ACTION THERE WAS A HEAVYSTORM OF RAIN AND HAIL IN GENERAL THE SUMMER OF  WAS REMARKABLEFOR ITS STORMSTHE TWO PAVLOGRAD SQUADRONS WERE BIVOUACKING ON A FIELD OF RYE WHICHWAS ALREADY IN EAR BUT HAD BEEN COMPLETELY TRODDEN DOWN BY CATTLE ANDHORSES THE RAIN WAS DESCENDING IN TORRENTS AND ROSTOV WITH A YOUNGOFFICER NAMED ILYIN HIS PROTEGE WAS SITTING IN A HASTILY CONSTRUCTEDSHELTER AN OFFICER OF THEIR REGIMENT WITH LONG MUSTACHES EXTENDINGONTO HIS CHEEKS WHO AFTER RIDING TO THE STAFF HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THERAIN ENTERED ROSTOVS SHELTERI HAVE COME FROM THE STAFF COUNT HAVE YOU HEARD OF RAEVSKISEXPLOITAND THE OFFICER GAVE THEM DETAILS OF THE SALTANOV BATTLE WHICH HE HADHEARD AT THE STAFFROSTOV SMOKING HIS PIPE AND TURNING HIS HEAD ABOUT AS THE WATERTRICKLED DOWN HIS NECK LISTENED INATTENTIVELY WITH AN OCCASIONALGLANCE AT ILYIN WHO WAS PRESSING CLOSE TO HIM THIS OFFICER A LAD OFSIXTEEN WHO HAD RECENTLY JOINED THE REGIMENT WAS NOW IN THE SAMERELATION TO NICHOLAS THAT NICHOLAS HAD BEEN TO DENISOV SEVEN YEARSBEFORE ILYIN TRIED TO IMITATE ROSTOV IN EVERYTHING AND ADORED HIM AS AGIRL MIGHT HAVE DONEZDRZHINSKI THE OFFICER WITH THE LONG MUSTACHE SPOKE GRANDILOQUENTLY OFTHE SALTANOV DAM BEING A RUSSIAN THERMOPYLAE AND OF HOW A DEED WORTHYOF ANTIQUITY HAD BEEN PERFORMED BY GENERAL RAEVSKI HE RECOUNTED HOWRAEVSKI HAD LED HIS TWO SONS ONTO THE DAM UNDER TERRIFIC FIRE AND HADCHARGED WITH THEM BESIDE HIM ROSTOV HEARD THE STORY AND NOT ONLY SAIDNOTHING TO ENCOURAGE ZDRZHINSKIS ENTHUSIASM BUT ON THE CONTRARYLOOKED LIKE A MAN ASHAMED OF WHAT HE WAS HEARING THOUGH WITH NOINTENTION OF CONTRADICTING IT SINCE THE CAMPAIGNS OF AUSTERLITZ AND OF ROSTOV KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT MEN ALWAYS LIE WHEN DESCRIBINGMILITARY EXPLOITS AS HE HIMSELF HAD DONE WHEN RECOUNTING THEM BESIDESTHAT HE HAD EXPERIENCE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT NOTHING HAPPENS IN WAR ATALL AS WE CAN IMAGINE OR RELATE IT AND SO HE DID NOT LIKE ZDRZHINSKISTALE NOR DID HE LIKE ZDRZHINSKI HIMSELF WHO WITH HIS MUSTACHESEXTENDING OVER HIS CHEEKS BENT LOW OVER THE FACE OF HIS HEARER AS WASHIS HABIT AND CROWDED ROSTOV IN THE NARROW SHANTY ROSTOV LOOKED AT HIMIN SILENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH A CONFUSIONAND CROWDING ON THE DAM THAT WAS BEING ATTACKED THAT IF RAEVSKI DID LEADHIS SONS THERE IT COULD HAVE HAD NO EFFECT EXCEPT PERHAPS ON SOME DOZENMEN NEAREST TO HIM THOUGHT HE THE REST COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HOW ORWITH WHOM RAEVSKI CAME ONTO THE DAM AND EVEN THOSE WHO DID SEE IT WOULDNOT HAVE BEEN MUCH STIMULATED BY IT FOR WHAT HAD THEY TO DO WITHRAEVSKIS TENDER PATERNAL FEELINGS WHEN THEIR OWN SKINS WERE IN DANGERAND BESIDES THE FATE OF THE FATHERLAND DID NOT DEPEND ON WHETHER THEYTOOK THE SALTANOV DAM OR NOT AS WE ARE TOLD WAS THE CASE ATTHERMOPYLAE SO WHY SHOULD HE HAVE MADE SUCH A SACRIFICE AND WHY EXPOSEHIS OWN CHILDREN IN THE BATTLE I WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN MY BROTHER PETYATHERE OR EVEN ILYIN WHOS A STRANGER TO ME BUT A NICE LAD BUT WOULDHAVE TRIED TO PUT THEM SOMEWHERE UNDER COVER NICHOLAS CONTINUED TOTHINK AS HE LISTENED TO ZDRZHINSKI BUT HE DID NOT EXPRESS HISTHOUGHTS FOR IN SUCH MATTERS TOO HE HAD GAINED EXPERIENCE HE KNEWTHAT THIS TALE REDOUNDED TO THE GLORY OF

DOCTORS AS IT CANNOT OCCUR TO A WIZARDTHAT HE IS UNABLE TO WORK HIS CHARMS BECAUSE THE BUSINESS OF THEIRLIVES WAS TO CURE AND THEY RECEIVED MONEY FOR IT AND HAD SPENT THE BESTYEARS OF THEIR LIVES ON THAT BUSINESS BUT ABOVE ALL THAT THOUGHT WASKEPT OUT OF THEIR MINDS BY THE FACT THAT THEY SAW THEY WERE REALLYUSEFUL AS IN FACT THEY WERE TO THE WHOLE ROSTOV FAMILY THEIRUSEFULNESS DID NOT DEPEND ON MAKING THE PATIENT SWALLOW SUBSTANCES FORTHE MOST PART HARMFUL THE HARM WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AS THEY WEREGIVEN IN SMALL DOSES BUT THEY WERE USEFUL NECESSARY ANDINDISPENSABLE BECAUSE THEY SATISFIED A MENTAL NEED OF THE INVALID AND OFTHOSE WHO LOVED HERAND THAT IS WHY THERE ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BEPSEUDOHEALERS WISE WOMEN HOMEOPATHS AND ALLOPATHS THEY SATISFIEDTHAT ETERNAL HUMAN NEED FOR HOPE OF

PLEASANT TO BE ABLE TOSHOW BY DISREGARDING THE ORDERS THAT SHE DID NOT BELIEVE IN MEDICALTREATMENT AND DID NOT VALUE HER LIFETHE DOCTOR CAME EVERY DAY FELT HER PULSE LOOKED AT HER TONGUE ANDREGARDLESS OF HER GRIEFSTRICKEN FACE JOKED WITH HER BUT WHEN HE HADGONE INTO ANOTHER ROOM TO WHICH THE COUNTESS HURRIEDLY FOLLOWED HIM HEASSUMED A GRAVE AIR AND THOUGHTFULLY SHAKING HIS HEAD SAID THAT

GENTLEMANINWAITING HE IMAGINED THE EMPERORTO BE ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY GENTLEMENINWAITING THAT HE COUNT ROSTOVIN SPITE OF HIS YOUTH WISHED TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY THAT YOUTH COULD BENO HINDRANCE TO LOYALTY AND THAT HE WAS READY TO WHILE DRESSINGPETYA HAD PREPARED MANY FINE THINGS HE MEANT TO SAY TO THE GENTLEMANINWAITINGIT WAS ON THE VERY FACT OF BEING SO YOUNG THAT PETYA COUNTED FOR SUCCESSIN REACHING THE EMPERORHE EVEN THOUGHT HOW SURPRISED EVERYONE WOULD BEAT HIS YOUTHFULNESSAND YET IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS COLLAR AND HAIRAND BY HIS SEDATE DELIBERATE WALK HE WISHED TO APPEAR A GROWNUP MANBUT THE

STRIVING TO ATTAIN PERSONAL AIMS TOFURTHER THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A STUPENDOUS RESULT NO ONE OF THEM AT ALLEXPECTEDNEITHER NAPOLEON NOR ALEXANDER NOR STILL LESS ANY OF THOSEWHO DID THE ACTUAL FIGHTINGTHE CAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCH ARMY IN  IS CLEAR TO USNOW NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THAT CAUSE WAS ON THE ONE HAND ITS ADVANCEINTO THE HEART OF RUSSIA LATE IN THE SEASON WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION FORA WINTER CAMPAIGN AND ON THE OTHER THE CHARACTER GIVEN TO THE WAR BYTHE BURNING OF RUSSIAN TOWNS AND THE HATRED OF THE FOE THIS AROUSEDAMONG THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE BUT NO ONE AT THE TIME FORESAW WHAT NOW SEEMSSO EVIDENT THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY AN ARMY OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSANDMENTHE BEST IN THE WORLD AND LED BY THE BEST GENERALCOULD BEDESTROYED IN CONFLICT WITH A RAW ARMY OF HALF ITS NUMERICAL STRENGTHAND LED BY INEXPERIENCED COMMANDERS AS THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS NOT ONLYDID NO ONE SEE THIS BUT ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TOHINDER THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE RUSSIA WHILE ON THE FRENCH SIDEDESPITE NAPOLEONS EXPERIENCE AND SOCALLED MILITARY GENIUS EVERYEFFORT WAS DIRECTED TO PUSHING ON TO MOSCOW AT THE END OF THE SUMMERTHAT IS TO DOING THE VERY THING THAT WAS BOUND TO LEAD TO DESTRUCTIONIN HISTORICAL WORKS ON THE YEAR  FRENCH WRITERS ARE VERY FOND OFSAYING THAT NAPOLEON FELT THE DANGER OF EXTENDING HIS LINE THAT HESOUGHT A BATTLE AND THAT HIS MARSHALS ADVISED HIM TO STOP AT SMOLENSKAND OF MAKING SIMILAR STATEMENTS TO SHOW THAT THE DANGER OF THE CAMPAIGNWAS EVEN THEN UNDERSTOOD RUSSIAN AUTHORS ARE STILL FONDER OF TELLING USTHAT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN A SCYTHIAN WAR PLAN WASADOPTED TO LURE NAPOLEON INTO THE DEPTHS OF RUSSIA AND THIS PLAN SOMEOF THEM ATTRIBUTE TO PFUEL OTHERS TO A CERTAIN FRENCHMAN OTHERS TOTOLL AND OTHERS AGAIN TO ALEXANDER HIMSELFPOINTING TO NOTESPROJECTS AND LETTERS WHICH CONTAIN HINTS OF SUCH A LINE OF ACTION BUTALL THESE HINTS AT WHAT HAPPENED BOTH FROM THE FRENCH SIDE AND THERUSSIAN ARE ADVANCED ONLY BECAUSE THEY FIT IN WITH THE EVENT HAD THATEVENT NOT OCCURRED THESE HINTS WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN AS WE HAVEFORGOTTEN THE THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF HINTS AND EXPECTATIONS TO THECONTRARY WHICH WERE CURRENT THEN BUT HAVE NOW BEEN FORGOTTEN BECAUSE THEEVENT FALSIFIED THEM THERE ARE ALWAYS SO MANY CONJECTURES AS TO THEISSUE OF ANY EVENT THAT HOWEVER IT MAY END THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLETO SAY I SAID THEN THAT IT WOULD BE SO QUITE FORGETTING THAT AMIDTHEIR INNUMERABLE CONJECTURES MANY WERE TO QUITE THE CONTRARY EFFECTCONJECTURES AS TO NAPOLEONS AWARENESS OF THE DANGER OF EXTENDING HISLINE AND ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE AS TO LURING THE ENEMY INTO THE DEPTHSOF RUSSIA ARE EVIDENTLY OF THAT KIND AND ONLY BY MUCH STRAINING CANHISTORIANS ATTRIBUTE SUCH CONCEPTIONS TO NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS ORSUCH PLANS TO THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS ALL THE FACTS ARE IN FLATCONTRADICTION TO SUCH CONJECTURES DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THE WARNOT ONLY WAS THERE NO WISH ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE TO DRAW THE FRENCH INTOTHE HEART OF THE COUNTRY BUT FROM THEIR FIRST ENTRY INTO RUSSIAEVERYTHING WAS DONE TO STOP THEM AND NOT ONLY WAS NAPOLEON NOT AFRAIDTO EXTEND HIS LINE BUT HE WELCOMED EVERY STEP FORWARD AS A TRIUMPH ANDDID NOT SEEK BATTLE AS EAGERLY AS IN FORMER CAMPAIGNS BUT VERY LAZILYAT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE WAR OUR ARMIES WERE DIVIDED AND OUR SOLEAIM WAS TO UNITE THEM THOUGH UNITING THE ARMIES WAS NO ADVANTAGE IF WEMEANT TO RETIRE AND LURE THE ENEMY INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTRY OUREMPEROR JOINED THE ARMY TO ENCOURAGE IT TO DEFEND EVERY INCH OF RUSSIANSOIL AND NOT TO RETREAT THE ENORMOUS DRISSA CAMP WAS FORMED ON PFUELSPLAN AND THERE WAS NO INTENTION OF RETIRING FARTHER THE EMPERORREPROACHED THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF FOR EVERY STEP THEY RETIRED HE COULDNOT BEAR THE IDEA OF LETTING THE ENEMY EVEN REACH SMOLENSK STILL LESSCOULD HE CONTEMPLATE THE BURNING OF MOSCOW AND WHEN OUR ARMIES DIDUNITE HE WAS DISPLEASED THAT SMOLENSK WAS ABANDONED AND BURNED WITHOUT AGENERAL ENGAGEMENT HAVING BEEN FOUGHT UNDER ITS WALLSSO THOUGHT THE EMPEROR AND THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS AND PEOPLE WERE STILLMORE PROVOKED AT THE THOUGHT THAT OUR FORCES WERE RETREATING INTO THEDEPTHS OF THE COUNTRYNAPOLEON HAVING CUT OUR ARMIES APART ADVANCED FAR INTO THE COUNTRY ANDMISSED SEVERAL CHANCES OF FORCING AN ENGAGEMENT IN AUGUST HE WAS ATSMOLENSK AND THOUGHT ONLY OF HOW TO ADVANCE FARTHER THOUGH AS WE NOWSEE THAT ADVANCE WAS EVIDENTLY RUINOUS TO HIMTHE FACTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT NAPOLEON DID NOT FORESEE THE DANGER OF THEADVANCE ON MOSCOW NOR DID ALEXANDER AND THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS THENTHINK OF LURING NAPOLEON ON BUT QUITE THE CONTRARY THE LURING OFNAPOLEON INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTRY WAS NOT THE RESULT OF ANY PLANFOR NO ONE BELIEVED IT TO BE POSSIBLE IT RESULTED FROM A MOST COMPLEXINTERPLAY OF INTRIGUES AIMS AND WISHES AMONG THOSE WHO TOOK PART INTHE WAR AND HAD NO PERCEPTION WHATEVER OF THE INEVITABLE OR OF THE ONEWAY OF SAVING RUSSIA EVERYTHING CAME ABOUT FORTUITOUSLY THE ARMIESWERE DIVIDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN WE TRIED TO UNITETHEM WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF GIVING BATTLE AND CHECKING THEENEMYS ADVANCE AND BY THIS EFFORT TO UNITE THEM WHILE AVOIDING BATTLEWITH A MUCH STRONGER ENEMY AND NECESSARILY WITHDRAWING THE ARMIES AT ANACUTE ANGLEWE LED THE FRENCH ON TO SMOLENSK BUT WE WITHDREW AT ANACUTE ANGLE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE FRENCH ADVANCED BETWEEN OUR TWO ARMIESTHE ANGLE

ENCOURAGE IT BUT HIS PRESENCE ANDIGNORANCE OF WHAT STEPS TO TAKE AND THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ADVISERS ANDPLANS DESTROYED THE FIRST ARMYS ENERGY AND IT RETIREDTHE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE A STAND AT THE

PRETEXT FOR HIS DEPARTURE IT WAS DECIDED THAT IT WAS NECESSARYFOR HIM TO INSPIRE THE PEOPLE IN THE CAPITALS AND AROUSE THE NATION INGENERAL TO A PATRIOTIC WAR AND BY THIS VISIT OF THE EMPEROR TO MOSCOWTHE STRENGTH OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS TREBLEDHE LEFT IN ORDER NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE COMMANDERINCHIEFS UNDIVIDEDCONTROL OF THE ARMY AND HOPING THAT MORE DECISIVE ACTION WOULD THEN BETAKEN BUT THE

RECENT DAYS OF PATRIOTIC ELATION AND ARDOR HARD TO BELIEVETHAT RUSSIA WAS REALLY IN DANGER AND THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE ENGLISHCLUB WERE ALSO SONS OF THE FATHERLAND READY TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING FORIT THE ONE THING THAT RECALLED THE PATRIOTIC FERVOR EVERYONE HADDISPLAYED DURING THE EMPERORS STAY WAS THE CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OFMEN AND MONEY A NECESSITY THAT AS SOON AS THE PROMISES HAD BEEN MADEASSUMED A LEGAL OFFICIAL FORM AND BECAME UNAVOIDABLEWITH THE ENEMYS APPROACH TO MOSCOW THE MOSCOVITES VIEW OF THEIRSITUATION DID NOT GROW MORE SERIOUS BUT ON THE CONTRARY BECAME EVEN MOREFRIVOLOUS AS ALWAYS HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WHO SEE A GREAT DANGERAPPROACHING AT THE APPROACH OF DANGER THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO VOICES THATSPEAK WITH EQUAL POWER IN THE HUMAN SOUL ONE VERY REASONABLY TELLS AMAN TO CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE DANGER AND THE MEANS OF ESCAPING ITTHE OTHER STILL MORE REASONABLY SAYS THAT IT IS TOO DEPRESSING ANDPAINFUL TO THINK OF THE DANGER SINCE IT IS NOT IN MANS POWER TOFORESEE EVERYTHING AND AVERT THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND IT ISTHEREFORE BETTER TO DISREGARD WHAT IS PAINFUL TILL IT COMES AND TOTHINK ABOUT WHAT IS PLEASANT IN SOLITUDE A MAN GENERALLY LISTENS TO THEFIRST VOICE BUT IN SOCIETY TO THE SECOND SO IT WAS NOW WITH THEINHABITANTS OF MOSCOW IT WAS LONG SINCE PEOPLE HAD BEEN AS GAY INMOSCOW AS THAT YEARROSTOPCHINS BROADSHEETS HEADED BY WOODCUTS OF A

AS HE COULD AND THEFARTHER HE LEFT MOSCOW BEHIND AND THE DEEPER HE PLUNGED INTO THAT SEA OFTROOPS THE MORE WAS HE OVERCOME BY RESTLESS AGITATION AND A NEW ANDJOYFUL FEELING HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE IT WAS A FEELING AKIN TOWHAT HE HAD FELT AT THE SLOBODA PALACE DURING THE EMPERORS VISITASENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF UNDERTAKING SOMETHING AND SACRIFICINGSOMETHING HE NOW EXPERIENCED A GLAD CONSCIOUSNESS THAT EVERYTHING THATCONSTITUTES MENS HAPPINESSTHE COMFORTS OF LIFE WEALTH EVEN LIFEITSELFIS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY COMPARED WITHSOMETHING WITH WHAT PIERRE COULD NOT SAY AND HE DID NOT TRY TODETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT INSACRIFICING EVERYTHING HE WAS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT TOSACRIFICE FOR THE FACT OF SACRIFICING IN ITSELF AFFORDED HIM A NEW ANDJOYOUS SENSATIONCHAPTER XIXON THE TWENTYFOURTH OF AUGUST THE BATTLE OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WASFOUGHT ON THE TWENTYFIFTH NOT A SHOT WAS FIRED BY EITHER SIDE AND ONTHE TWENTYSIXTH THE BATTLE OF BORODINO ITSELF TOOK PLACEWHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVARDINO AND BORODINO GIVEN ANDACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEASTSENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULTFOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE THAT WE WERE BROUGHT NEARERTO THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOWWHICH WE FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THEWORLD AND FOR THE FRENCH ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WEREBROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR WHOLE ARMYWHICH THEY FEAREDMORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WHAT THE RESULT MUST BE WAS QUITEOBVIOUS AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLEIF THE COMMANDERS HAD BEEN GUIDED BY REASON IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT MUSTHAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO NAPOLEON THAT BY ADVANCING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILESAND GIVING BATTLE WITH A PROBABILITY OF LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY HEWAS ADVANCING TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EQUALLYCLEAR TO KUTUZOV THAT BY ACCEPTING BATTLE AND RISKING THE LOSS OF AQUARTER OF HIS ARMY HE WOULD CERTAINLY LOSE MOSCOW FOR KUTUZOV THIS WASMATHEMATICALLY CLEAR AS IT IS THAT IF WHEN PLAYING DRAUGHTS I HAVE ONEMAN LESS AND GO ON EXCHANGING I SHALL CERTAINLY LOSE AND THEREFORESHOULD NOT EXCHANGE WHEN MY OPPONENT HAS SIXTEEN MEN AND I HAVEFOURTEEN I AM ONLY ONE EIGHTH WEAKER THAN HE BUT WHEN I HAVE EXCHANGEDTHIRTEEN MORE MEN HE WILL BE THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS I AMBEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO OUR STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO THE FRENCHWAS ABOUT AS FIVE TO SIX BUT AFTER THAT BATTLE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THANONE TO TWO PREVIOUSLY WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED ANDTWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST AHUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THEBATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON WHO WAS SAID TO BE A COMMANDER OF GENIUS GAVEIT LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY AND LENGTHENING HIS LINES OFCOMMUNICATION STILL MORE IF IT IS SAID THAT HE EXPECTED TO END THECAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING MOSCOW AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BYOCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEONSHISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLENSK ONWARDS HE WISHED TOSTOP KNEW THE DANGER OF HIS EXTENDED POSITION AND KNEW THAT THEOCCUPATION OF MOSCOW WOULD NOT BE THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR HE HADSEEN AT SMOLENSK THE STATE IN WHICH RUSSIAN TOWNS WERE LEFT TO HIM ANDHAD NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE REPLY TO HIS REPEATED ANNOUNCEMENTS OF HISWISH TO NEGOTIATEIN GIVING AND ACCEPTING BATTLE AT BORODINO KUTUZOV ACTED INVOLUNTARILYAND IRRATIONALLY BUT LATER ON TO FIT WHAT HAD OCCURRED THE HISTORIANSPROVIDED CUNNINGLY DEVISED EVIDENCE OF THE FORESIGHT AND GENIUS OF THEGENERALS WHO OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVEDAND INVOLUNTARYTHE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISHTHE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY AND WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO ACCUSTOMOURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT FOR OUR EPOCH HISTORIES OF THAT KIND AREMEANINGLESSON THE OTHER QUESTION HOW THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE PRECEDINGBATTLE OF SHEVARDINO WERE FOUGHT THERE ALSO EXISTS A DEFINITE AND WELLKNOWN BUT QUITE FALSE CONCEPTION ALL THE HISTORIANS DESCRIBE THEAFFAIR AS FOLLOWSTHE RUSSIAN ARMY THEY SAY IN ITS RETREAT FROM SMOLENSK SOUGHT OUT FORITSELF THE BEST POSITION FOR A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT AND FOUND SUCH APOSITION AT BORODINOTHE RUSSIANS THEY SAY FORTIFIED THIS POSITION IN ADVANCE ON THE LEFTOF THE HIGHROAD FROM MOSCOW TO SMOLENSK AND ALMOST AT A RIGHT ANGLE TOIT FROM BORODINO TO UTITSA AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WASFOUGHTIN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ONTHE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTYFOURTH WE ARETOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT AND ON THETWENTYSIXTH ATTACKED THE WHOLE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WAS IN POSITION ONTHE FIELD OF BORODINOSO THE HISTORIES SAY AND IT IS ALL QUITE WRONG AS ANYONE WHO CARES TOLOOK INTO THE MATTER CAN EASILY CONVINCE HIMSELFTHE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEK OUT THE BEST POSITION BUT ON THE CONTRARYDURING THE RETREAT PASSED MANY POSITIONS BETTER THAN BORODINO THEY DIDNOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTUZOV DID NOT WISH TOOCCUPY A POSITION HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMANDFOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSEMILORADOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHERREASONS THE FACT IS THAT OTHER POSITIONS THEY HAD PASSED WERE STRONGERAND THAT THE POSITION AT BORODINO THE ONE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHTFAR FROM BEING STRONG WAS NO MORE A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER SPOT ONEMIGHT FIND IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BY STICKING A PIN INTO THE MAP ATHAZARDNOT ONLY DID THE RUSSIANS NOT FORTIFY THE POSITION ON THE FIELD OFBORODINO TO THE LEFT OF AND AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE HIGHROAD THAT ISTHE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THE TWENTYFIFTH OF AUGUST  DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BE FOUGHTTHERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO ENTRENCHMENTSTHERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH AND THAT THOSE BEGUN ON THE TWENTYFIFTH ANDTWENTYSIXTH WERE NOT COMPLETED AND SECONDLY BY THE POSITION OF THESHEVARDINO REDOUBT THAT REDOUBT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN FRONT OF THEPOSITION WHERE THE BATTLE WAS ACCEPTED WHY WAS IT MORE STRONGLYFORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTS EXHAUSTED ANDSIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE AT NIGHT ON THETWENTYFOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO OBSERVE THEENEMY THIRDLY AS PROOF THAT THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE WASFOUGHT HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS NOT ANADVANCED POST OF THAT POSITION WE HAVE THE FACT THAT UP TO THE TWENTYFIFTH BARCLAY DE TOLLY AND BAGRATION WERE CONVINCED THAT THE SHEVARDINOREDOUBT WAS THE LEFT FLANK OF THE POSITION AND THAT KUTUZOV HIMSELF INHIS REPORT WRITTEN IN HOT HASTE AFTER THE BATTLE SPEAKS OF THESHEVARDINO REDOUBT AS THE LEFT FLANK OF THE POSITION IT WAS MUCH LATERWHEN REPORTS ON THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WERE WRITTEN AT LEISURE THAT THEINCORRECT AND EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT WAS INVENTED PROBABLY TO JUSTIFYTHE MISTAKES OF A COMMANDERINCHIEF WHO HAD TO BE REPRESENTED ASINFALLIBLE THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POSTWHEREAS INREALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANKAND THAT THEBATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION PREVIOUSLYSELECTED WHERE AS IT WAS FOUGHT ON A QUITE UNEXPECTED SPOT WHICH WASALMOST UNENTRENCHEDTHE CASE WAS EVIDENTLY THIS A POSITION WAS SELECTED ALONG THE RIVERKOLOCHAWHICH CROSSES THE HIGHROAD NOT AT A RIGHT ANGLE BUT AT AN ACUTEANGLESO THAT THE LEFT FLANK WAS AT SHEVARDINO THE RIGHT FLANK NEARTHE VILLAGE OF NOVOE AND THE CENTER AT BORODINO AT THE CONFLUENCE OFTHE RIVERS KOLOCHA AND VOYNATO ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THE FIELD OF BORODINO WITHOUT THINKING OF HOW THEBATTLE WAS ACTUALLY FOUGHT THIS POSITION PROTECTED BY THE RIVERKOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TOPREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOWNAPOLEON RIDING TO VALUEVO ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DID NOT SEE AS THEHISTORY BOOKS SAY HE DID THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANS FROM UTITSA TOBORODINO HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT DID NOTEXIST NOR DID HE SEE AN ADVANCED POST OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY BUT WHILEPURSUING THE RUSSIAN REARGUARD HE CAME UPON THE LEFT FLANK OF THERUSSIAN POSITIONAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBTAND UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THERUSSIANS MOVED HIS ARMY ACROSS THE KOLOCHA AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVINGTIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THEPOSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICHHAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED BY CROSSING TO THE OTHERSIDE OF THE KOLOCHA TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHROAD NAPOLEON SHIFTED THEWHOLE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT LOOKING FROM THE RUSSIANSIDE AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PLAIN BETWEEN UTITSA SEMENOVSK ANDBORODINOA PLAIN NO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POSITION THAN ANY OTHERPLAIN IN RUSSIAAND THERE THE WHOLE BATTLE OF THE TWENTYSIXTH OFAUGUST TOOK PLACEHAD NAPOLEON NOT RIDDEN OUT ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTYFOURTH TO THEKOLOCHA AND HAD HE NOT THEN ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE ATTACK ON THE REDOUBTBUT HAD BEGUN THE ATTACK NEXT MORNING NO ONE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED THATTHE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS THE LEFT FLANK OF OUR POSITION AND THEBATTLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHERE WE EXPECTED IT IN THAT CASE WESHOULD PROBABLY HAVE DEFENDED THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBTOUR LEFT FLANKSTILL MORE OBSTINATELY WE SHOULD HAVE ATTACKED NAPOLEON IN THE CENTEROR ON THE RIGHT AND THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THETWENTYFIFTH IN THE POSITION WE INTENDED AND HAD FORTIFIED BUT AS THEATTACK ON OUR LEFT FLANK TOOK PLACE IN THE EVENING AFTER THE RETREAT OFOUR REAR GUARD THAT IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIGHT AT GRIDNEVA ANDAS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN AGENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTYFOURTH THE FIRSTAND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS ALREADY LOST ON THETWENTYFOURTH AND OBVIOUSLY LED TO THE LOSS OF THE ONE FOUGHT ON THETWENTYSIXTHAFTER THE LOSS OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WE FOUND OURSELVES ON THEMORNING OF THE TWENTYFIFTH WITHOUT A POSITION FOR OUR LEFT FLANK ANDWERE FORCED TO BEND IT BACK AND HASTILY ENTRENCH IT WHERE IT CHANCED TOBENOT ONLY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMY ON THE TWENTYSIXTH DEFENDED BY WEAKUNFINISHED ENTRENCHMENTS BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT POSITION WASINCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERSNOT HAVING FULLYREALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED NAMELY THE LOSS OF OUR POSITION ON THE LEFTFLANK AND THE SHIFTING OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROMRIGHT TO LEFTMAINTAINED THEIR EXTENDED POSITION FROM THE VILLAGE OFNOVOE TO UTITSA AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO MOVE THEIR FORCES FROM RIGHT TOLEFT DURING THE BATTLE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BATTLETHE RUSSIANS OPPOSED THE ENTIRE FRENCH ARMY LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR LEFTFLANK WITH BUT HALF AS MANY MEN PONIATOWSKIS ACTION AGAINST UTITSAAND UVAROVS ON THE RIGHT FLANK AGAINST THE FRENCH WERE ACTIONSDISTINCT FROM THE MAIN COURSE OF THE BATTLE SO THE BATTLE OF BORODINODID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL AS IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL OUR COMMANDERSMISTAKES EVEN AT THE COST OF DIMINISHING THE GLORY DUE TO THE RUSSIANARMY AND PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS NOTFOUGHT ON A CHOSEN AND ENTRENCHED POSITION WITH FORCES ONLY SLIGHTLYWEAKER THAN THOSE OF THE ENEMY BUT AS A RESULT OF THE LOSS OF THESHEVARDINO REDOUBT THE RUSSIANS FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO ON ANOPEN AND ALMOST UNENTRENCHED POSITION WITH FORCES ONLY HALF AS NUMEROUSAS THE FRENCH THAT IS TO SAY UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH IT WAS NOTMERELY UNTHINKABLE TO FIGHT FOR TEN HOURS AND SECURE AN INDECISIVERESULT BUT UNTHINKABLE TO KEEP AN ARMY EVEN FROM COMPLETEDISINTEGRATION AND FLIGHTCHAPTER XXON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTYFIFTH PIERRE WAS LEAVING MOZHAYSK AT THEDESCENT OF THE HIGH STEEP HILL DOWN WHICH A WINDING ROAD LED OUT OF THETOWN PAST THE CATHEDRAL ON THE RIGHT WHERE A SERVICE WAS

ETMETHODE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE RETAINING TROOPS IN RESERVETHE IMPERIAL CAMP NEAR MOZHAYSKSEPTEMBER  THESE DISPOSITIONS WHICH ARE VERY OBSCURE AND CONFUSED IF ONE ALLOWSONESELF TO REGARD THE ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT RELIGIOUS AWE OF HIS GENIUSRELATED TO NAPOLEONS ORDERS TO DEAL WITH FOUR POINTSFOUR DIFFERENTORDERS NOT ONE OF THESE WAS OR COULD BE CARRIED OUTIN THE DISPOSITION IT IS SAID FIRST THAT THE BATTERIES PLACED ON THESPOT CHOSEN BY NAPOLEON WITH THE GUNS OF PERNETTI AND FOUCHE WHICHWERE TO COME IN LINE WITH THEM  GUNS IN ALL WERE TO OPEN FIRE ANDSHOWER SHELLS ON THE RUSSIAN FLECHES AND REDOUBTS THIS COULD NOT BEDONE AS FROM THE SPOTS SELECTED BY NAPOLEON THE PROJECTILES DID NOTCARRY TO THE RUSSIAN WORKS AND THOSE  GUNS SHOT INTO THE AIR UNTILTHE NEAREST COMMANDER CONTRARY TO NAPOLEONS INSTRUCTIONS MOVED THEMFORWARDTHE SECOND ORDER WAS THAT PONIATOWSKI MOVING TO THE VILLAGE THROUGH THEWOOD SHOULD TURN THE RUSSIAN LEFT FLANK THIS COULD NOT BE DONE AND WASNOT DONE BECAUSE PONIATOWSKI ADVANCING ON THE VILLAGE THROUGH THEWOOD MET TUCHKOV THERE BARRING HIS WAY AND COULD NOT AND DID NOT TURNTHE RUSSIAN POSITIONTHE THIRD ORDER WAS GENERAL CAMPAN WILL MOVE THROUGH THE WOOD

AREGIVEN WHICH UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP WILL BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE REDOUBTAND COME INTO LINE WITH THE REST OF THE FORCESAS FAR AS ONE CAN MAKE OUT NOT SO MUCH FROM THIS UNINTELLIGIBLESENTENCE AS FROM THE ATTEMPTS THE VICEKING MADE TO EXECUTE THE ORDERSGIVEN HIM HE WAS TO ADVANCE FROM THE LEFT THROUGH BORODINO TO THEREDOUBT WHILE THE DIVISIONS OF MORAND AND GERARD WERE TO ADVANCESIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE FRONTALL THIS LIKE THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DISPOSITION WAS NOT AND COULD NOTBE EXECUTED AFTER PASSING THROUGH BORODINO THE VICEKING WAS DRIVENBACK TO THE KOLOCHA AND COULD GET NO FARTHER WHILE THE DIVISIONS OFMORAND AND GERARD DID NOT TAKE THE REDOUBT BUT WERE DRIVEN BACK AND THEREDOUBT WAS ONLY TAKEN AT THE END OF THE BATTLE BY THE CAVALRY A THINGPROBABLY UNFORESEEN AND NOT HEARD OF BY NAPOLEON SO NOT ONE OF THEORDERS IN THE DISPOSITION WAS OR COULD BE EXECUTED BUT IN THEDISPOSITION IT IS SAID THAT AFTER THE FIGHT HAS COMMENCED IN THISMANNER ORDERS WILL BE GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ENEMYS MOVEMENTSAND SO IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BEMADE BY NAPOLEON DURING THE BATTLE BUT THIS WAS NOT AND COULD NOT BEDONE FOR DURING THE WHOLE BATTLE NAPOLEON WAS SO FAR AWAY THAT ASAPPEARED LATER HE COULD NOT KNOW THE COURSE OF THE BATTLE AND NOT ONEOF HIS ORDERS DURING THE FIGHT COULD BE EXECUTEDCHAPTER XXVIIIMANY HISTORIANS SAY THAT THE FRENCH DID NOT WIN THE BATTLE OF BORODINOBECAUSE NAPOLEON HAD A COLD AND THAT IF HE HAD NOT HAD A COLD THEORDERS HE GAVE BEFORE AND DURING THE BATTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MOREFULL OF GENIUS AND RUSSIA WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AND THE FACE OF THE WORLDHAVE BEEN CHANGED TO HISTORIANS WHO BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA WAS SHAPED BYTHE WILL OF ONE MANPETER THE GREATAND THAT FRANCE FROM A REPUBLICBECAME AN EMPIRE AND FRENCH ARMIES WENT TO RUSSIA AT THE WILL OF ONEMANNAPOLEONTO SAY THAT RUSSIA REMAINED A POWER BECAUSE NAPOLEON HADA BAD COLD ON THE TWENTYFOURTH OF AUGUST MAY SEEM LOGICAL ANDCONVINCINGIF IT HAD DEPENDED ON NAPOLEONS WILL TO FIGHT OR NOT TO FIGHT THEBATTLE OF BORODINO AND IF THIS OR THAT OTHER ARRANGEMENT DEPENDED ONHIS WILL THEN EVIDENTLY A COLD AFFECTING THE MANIFESTATION OF HIS WILLMIGHT HAVE SAVED RUSSIA AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALET WHO OMITTED TO BRINGNAPOLEON HIS WATERPROOF BOOTS ON THE TWENTYFOURTH WOULD HAVE BEEN THESAVIOR OF RUSSIA ALONG THAT LINE OF THOUGHT SUCH A DEDUCTION ISINDUBITABLE AS INDUBITABLE AS THE DEDUCTION VOLTAIRE MADE IN JESTWITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS JESTING AT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE MASSACREOF ST BARTHOLOMEW WAS DUE TO CHARLES IXS STOMACH BEING DERANGED BUTTO MEN WHO DO NOT ADMIT THAT RUSSIA WAS FORMED BY THE WILL OF ONE MANPETER I OR THAT THE FRENCH EMPIRE WAS FORMED AND THE WAR WITH RUSSIABEGUN BY THE WILL OF ONE MAN NAPOLEON THAT ARGUMENT SEEMS NOT MERELYUNTRUE AND IRRATIONAL BUT CONTRARY TO ALL HUMAN REALITY TO THEQUESTION OF WHAT CAUSES HISTORIC EVENTS ANOTHER ANSWER PRESENTS ITSELFNAMELY THAT THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IS PREDETERMINED FROM ON HIGHDEPENDS ON THE COINCIDENCE OF THE WILLS OF ALL WHO TAKE PART IN THEEVENTS AND THAT A NAPOLEONS INFLUENCE ON THE COURSE OF THESE EVENTS ISPURELY EXTERNAL AND FICTITIOUSSTRANGE AS AT FIRST GLANCE IT MAY SEEM TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MASSACRE OFST BARTHOLOMEW WAS NOT DUE TO CHARLES IXS WILL THOUGH HE GAVE THEORDER FOR IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS DONE AS A RESULT OF THAT ORDER ANDSTRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SLAUGHTER OF EIGHTY THOUSANDMEN AT BORODINO WAS NOT DUE TO NAPOLEONS WILL THOUGH HE ORDERED THECOMMENCEMENT AND CONDUCT OF THE BATTLE AND THOUGHT IT WAS DONE BECAUSEHE ORDERED IT STRANGE AS THESE SUPPOSITIONS APPEAR YET HUMAN DIGNITYWHICH TELLS ME THAT EACH OF US IS IF NOT MORE AT LEAST NOT LESS A MANTHAN THE GREAT NAPOLEONDEMANDS THE ACCEPTANCE OF THAT SOLUTION OF THEQUESTION AND HISTORIC INVESTIGATION ABUNDANTLY CONFIRMS ITAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO NAPOLEON SHOT AT NO ONE AND KILLED NO ONETHAT WAS ALL DONE BY THE SOLDIERS THEREFORE IT WAS NOT HE WHO KILLEDPEOPLETHE FRENCH SOLDIERS WENT TO KILL AND BE KILLED AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINONOT BECAUSE OF NAPOLEONS ORDERS BUT BY THEIR OWN VOLITION THE WHOLEARMYFRENCH ITALIAN GERMAN POLISH AND DUTCHHUNGRY RAGGED ANDWEARY OF THE CAMPAIGN FELT AT THE SIGHT OF AN ARMY BLOCKING THEIR ROADTO MOSCOW THAT THE WINE WAS DRAWN AND MUST BE DRUNK HAD NAPOLEON THENFORBIDDEN THEM TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM ANDHAVE PROCEEDED TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS BECAUSE IT WAS INEVITABLEWHEN THEY HEARD NAPOLEONS PROCLAMATION OFFERING THEM AS COMPENSATIONFOR MUTILATION AND DEATH THE WORDS OF POSTERITY ABOUT THEIR HAVING BEENIN THE BATTLE BEFORE MOSCOW THEY CRIED VIVE LEMPEREUR JUST AS THEYHAD CRIED VIVE LEMPEREUR AT THE SIGHT OF THE PORTRAIT OF THE BOYPIERCING THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WITH A TOY STICK AND JUST AS THEY WOULDHAVE CRIED VIVE LEMPEREUR AT ANY NONSENSE THAT MIGHT BE TOLD THEMTHERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO DO BUT CRY VIVE LEMPEREUR AND GOTO FIGHT IN ORDER TO GET FOOD AND REST AS CONQUERORS IN MOSCOW SO ITWAS NOT BECAUSE OF NAPOLEONS COMMANDS THAT THEY KILLED THEIR FELLOWMENAND IT WAS NOT NAPOLEON WHO DIRECTED THE COURSE OF THE BATTLE FOR NONEOF HIS ORDERS WERE EXECUTED AND DURING THE BATTLE HE DID NOT KNOW WHATWAS GOING ON BEFORE HIM SO THE WAY IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE KILLED ONEANOTHER WAS NOT DECIDED BY NAPOLEONS WILL BUT OCCURRED INDEPENDENTLY OFHIM IN ACCORD WITH THE WILL OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO TOOKPART IN THE COMMON ACTION IT ONLY SEEMED TO NAPOLEON THAT IT ALL TOOKPLACE BY HIS WILL AND SO THE QUESTION WHETHER HE HAD OR HAD NOT A COLDHAS NO MORE HISTORIC INTEREST THAN THE COLD OF THE LEAST OF THETRANSPORT SOLDIERSMOREOVER THE ASSERTION MADE BY VARIOUS WRITERS THAT HIS COLD WAS THECAUSE OF HIS DISPOSITIONS NOT BEING AS WELLPLANNED AS ON FORMEROCCASIONS AND OF HIS ORDERS DURING THE BATTLE NOT BEING AS GOOD ASPREVIOUSLY IS QUITE BASELESS WHICH AGAIN SHOWS THAT NAPOLEONS COLD ONTHE TWENTYSIXTH OF AUGUST WAS UNIMPORTANTTHE DISPOSITIONS CITED ABOVE ARE NOT AT ALL WORSE BUT ARE EVEN BETTERTHAN PREVIOUS DISPOSITIONS BY WHICH HE HAD WON VICTORIES HIS PSEUDOORDERS DURING THE BATTLE WERE ALSO NO WORSE THAN FORMERLY BUT MUCH THESAME AS USUAL THESE DISPOSITIONS AND ORDERS ONLY SEEM WORSE THANPREVIOUS ONES BECAUSE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS THE FIRST NAPOLEON DIDNOT WIN THE PROFOUNDEST AND MOST EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND ORDERS SEEMVERY BAD AND EVERY LEARNED MILITARIST CRITICIZES THEM WITH LOOKS OFIMPORTANCE WHEN THEY RELATE TO A BATTLE THAT HAS BEEN LOST AND THEVERY WORST DISPOSITIONS AND ORDERS SEEM VERY GOOD AND SERIOUS PEOPLEFILL WHOLE VOLUMES TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR MERITS WHEN THEY RELATE TO ABATTLE THAT HAS BEEN WONTHE DISPOSITIONS DRAWN UP BY WEYROTHER FOR THE BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ WEREA MODEL OF PERFECTION FOR THAT KIND OF COMPOSITION BUT STILL THEY WERECRITICIZEDCRITICIZED FOR THEIR VERY PERFECTION FOR THEIR EXCESSIVEMINUTENESSNAPOLEON AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FULFILLED HIS OFFICE ASREPRESENTATIVE OF AUTHORITY AS WELL AS AND EVEN BETTER THAN AT OTHERBATTLES HE DID NOTHING HARMFUL TO THE PROGRESS OF THE BATTLE HEINCLINED TO THE MOST REASONABLE OPINIONS HE MADE NO CONFUSION DID NOTCONTRADICT HIMSELF DID NOT GET FRIGHTENED OR RUN AWAY FROM THE

HISMARSHALS KEPT GALLOPING UP TO NAPOLEON WITH REPORTS OF THE PROGRESS OFTHE ACTION BUT ALL THESE REPORTS WERE FALSE BOTH BECAUSE IT WASIMPOSSIBLE IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE TO SAY WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT ANY GIVENMOMENT AND BECAUSE MANY OF THE ADJUTANTS DID NOT GO TO THE ACTUAL PLACEOF CONFLICT BUT REPORTED WHAT THEY HAD HEARD FROM OTHERS AND ALSOBECAUSE WHILE AN ADJUTANT WAS RIDING MORE THAN A MILE TO NAPOLEONCIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED AND THE NEWS HE BROUGHT WAS ALREADY BECOMINGFALSE THUS AN ADJUTANT GALLOPED UP FROM MURAT WITH TIDINGS THATBORODINO HAD BEEN OCCUPIED AND THE BRIDGE OVER THE KOLOCHA

BUTLIKE NAPOLEON DID NOT TAKE PART IN THE ACTUAL FIGHTING AND ONLYOCCASIONALLY WENT WITHIN MUSKET RANGE MADE THEIR OWN ARRANGEMENTSWITHOUT ASKING NAPOLEON AND ISSUED ORDERS WHERE AND IN WHAT DIRECTION

BORODINO GORKI SHEVARDINO ANDSEMENOVSK HAD REAPED THEIR HARVESTS AND PASTURED THEIR CATTLE AT THEDRESSING STATIONS THE GRASS AND EARTH WERE SOAKED WITH BLOOD FOR A SPACEOF SOME THREE ACRES AROUND

FORWARD LED BY THEIR OFFICERS OTHERS HELDTHEIR GROUND AND CONTINUED TO FIREOVER THE WHOLE FIELD PREVIOUSLY SO GAILY BEAUTIFUL WITH THE GLITTER OFBAYONETS AND CLOUDLETS OF SMOKE IN THE MORNING SUN THERE NOW SPREAD AMIST OF DAMP AND SMOKE AND A STRANGE ACID SMELL OF SALTPETER AND BLOODCLOUDS GATHERED AND DROPS OF RAIN BEGAN TO FALL ON THE DEAD AND WOUNDEDON THE FRIGHTENED EXHAUSTED AND HESITATING MEN AS IF TO SAY ENOUGHMEN ENOUGH CEASE BETHINK YOURSELVES WHAT ARE YOU DOINGTO THE MEN OF BOTH SIDES ALIKE WORN OUT BY WANT OF FOOD AND REST ITBEGAN EQUALLY TO APPEAR DOUBTFUL WHETHER THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TOSLAUGHTER ONE ANOTHER ALL THE FACES EXPRESSED HESITATION AND THEQUESTION AROSE IN EVERY SOUL FOR WHAT FOR WHOM MUST I KILL AND BEKILLED YOU MAY GO AND KILL WHOM YOU PLEASE BUT I DONT WANT TO DOSO ANYMORE BY EVENING THIS THOUGHT HAD RIPENED IN EVERY SOUL AT ANYMOMENT THESE MEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH HORROR AT WHAT THEY WEREDOING AND MIGHT HAVE THROWN UP EVERYTHING AND RUN AWAY ANYWHEREBUT THOUGH TOWARD THE END OF THE BATTLE THE MEN FELT ALL THE HORROR OFWHAT THEY WERE DOING THOUGH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO LEAVE OFFSOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE MYSTERIOUS POWER CONTINUED TO CONTROL THEM ANDTHEY STILL BROUGHT UP THE CHARGES LOADED AIMED AND APPLIED THE MATCHTHOUGH ONLY ONE ARTILLERYMAN SURVIVED OUT OF EVERY THREE AND THOUGHTHEY STUMBLED AND PANTED WITH FATIGUE PERSPIRING AND STAINED WITH BLOODAND POWDER THE CANNON BALLS FLEW JUST AS SWIFTLY AND CRUELLY FROM BOTHSIDES CRUSHING HUMAN BODIES AND THAT TERRIBLE WORK WHICH WAS NOT DONEBY THE WILL OF A MAN BUT AT THE WILL OF HIM WHO GOVERNS MEN AND WORLDSCONTINUEDANYONE LOOKING AT THE DISORGANIZED REAR OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY WOULD HAVESAID THAT IF ONLY THE FRENCH MADE ONE MORE SLIGHT EFFORT IT WOULDDISAPPEAR AND ANYONE LOOKING AT THE REAR OF THE FRENCH ARMY WOULD HAVESAID THAT THE RUSSIANS NEED ONLY MAKE ONE MORE SLIGHT EFFORT AND THEFRENCH WOULD BE DESTROYED BUT NEITHER THE FRENCH NOR THE RUSSIANS MADETHAT EFFORT AND THE FLAME OF BATTLE BURNED SLOWLY OUTTHE RUSSIANS DID NOT MAKE THAT EFFORT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTACKINGTHE FRENCH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE THEY STOOD BLOCKING THE WAYTO MOSCOW AND THEY STILL DID SO AT THE END OF THE BATTLE AS AT THEBEGINNING BUT EVEN HAD THE AIM OF THE RUSSIANS BEEN TO DRIVE THE FRENCHFROM THEIR POSITIONS THEY COULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS LAST EFFORT FOR ALLTHE RUSSIAN TROOPS HAD BEEN BROKEN UP THERE WAS NO PART OF THE RUSSIANARMY THAT HAD NOT SUFFERED IN THE BATTLE AND THOUGH STILL HOLDING THEIRPOSITIONS THEY HAD LOST ONE HALF OF THEIR ARMYTHE FRENCH WITH THE MEMORY OF ALL THEIR FORMER VICTORIES DURING FIFTEENYEARS WITH THE ASSURANCE OF NAPOLEONS INVINCIBILITY WITH THECONSCIOUSNESS THAT THEY HAD CAPTURED PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD AND HADLOST ONLY A QUARTER OF THEIR MEN AND STILL HAD THEIR GUARDS INTACTTWENTY THOUSAND STRONG MIGHT EASILY HAVE MADE THAT EFFORT THE FRENCHWHO HAD ATTACKED THE RUSSIAN ARMY IN ORDER TO DRIVE IT FROM ITS POSITIONOUGHT TO HAVE MADE THAT EFFORT FOR AS LONG AS THE RUSSIANS CONTINUED TOBLOCK THE ROAD TO MOSCOW AS BEFORE THE AIM OF THE FRENCH HAD NOT BEENATTAINED AND ALL THEIR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WERE IN VAIN BUT THE FRENCHDID NOT MAKE THAT EFFORT SOME HISTORIANS SAY THAT NAPOLEON NEED ONLYHAVE USED HIS OLD GUARDS WHO WERE INTACT AND THE BATTLE WOULD HAVEBEEN WON TO SPEAK OF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD NAPOLEON SENT HISGUARDS IS LIKE TALKING OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AUTUMN BECAME SPRING ITCOULD NOT BE NAPOLEON DID NOT GIVE HIS GUARDS NOT BECAUSE HE DID NOTWANT TO BUT BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE DONE ALL THE GENERALS OFFICERSAND SOLDIERS OF THE FRENCH ARMY KNEW IT COULD NOT BE DONE BECAUSE THEFLAGGING SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS WOULD NOT PERMIT ITIT WAS NOT NAPOLEON ALONE WHO HAD EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHTMARE FEELING OFTHE MIGHTY ARM BEING STRICKEN POWERLESS BUT ALL THE GENERALS ANDSOLDIERS OF HIS ARMY WHETHER THEY HAD TAKEN PART IN THE BATTLE OR NOTAFTER ALL THEIR EXPERIENCE OF PREVIOUS BATTLESWHEN AFTER ONE TENTH OFSUCH EFFORTS THE ENEMY HAD FLEDEXPERIENCED A SIMILAR FEELING OF TERRORBEFORE AN ENEMY WHO AFTER LOSING HALF HIS MEN STOOD AS THREATENINGLYAT THE END AS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE THE MORAL FORCE OF THEATTACKING FRENCH ARMY WAS EXHAUSTED NOT THAT SORT OF VICTORY WHICH ISDEFINED BY THE CAPTURE OF PIECES OF MATERIAL FASTENED TO STICKS CALLEDSTANDARDS AND OF THE GROUND ON WHICH THE TROOPS HAD STOOD AND WERESTANDING BUT A MORAL VICTORY THAT CONVINCES THE ENEMY OF THE MORALSUPERIORITY OF HIS OPPONENT AND OF HIS OWN IMPOTENCE WAS GAINED BY THERUSSIANS AT BORODINO THE FRENCH INVADERS LIKE AN INFURIATED ANIMALTHAT HAS IN ITS ONSLAUGHT RECEIVED A MORTAL WOUND FELT THAT THEY WEREPERISHING BUT COULD NOT STOP ANY MORE THAN THE RUSSIAN ARMY WEAKER BYONE HALF COULD HELP SWERVING BY IMPETUS GAINED THE FRENCH ARMY WASSTILL ABLE TO ROLL FORWARD TO MOSCOW BUT THERE WITHOUT FURTHER EFFORTON THE PART OF THE RUSSIANS IT HAD TO PERISH BLEEDING FROM THE MORTALWOUND IT HAD RECEIVED AT BORODINO

FROM THE ARBITRARYDIVISION OF CONTINUOUS MOTION INTO DISCONTINUOUS ELEMENTS THERE IS AWELL KNOWN SOCALLED SOPHISM OF THE ANCIENTS CONSISTING IN THIS THATACHILLES COULD NEVER CATCH UP WITH A TORTOISE HE WAS FOLLOWING IN SPITEOF THE FACT THAT HE TRAVELED TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THE TORTOISE BY THETIME ACHILLES HAS COVERED THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED HIM FROM THETORTOISE THE TORTOISE HAS COVERED ONE

THAT ACHILLES COULD NEVEROVERTAKE THE TORTOISE RESULTED FROM THIS THAT MOTION WAS ARBITRARILYDIVIDED INTO DISCONTINUOUS ELEMENTS WHEREAS THE MOTION BOTH OF ACHILLESAND OF THE TORTOISE WAS CONTINUOUSBY ADOPTING SMALLER AND SMALLER ELEMENTS OF MOTION WE ONLY APPROACH ASOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM BUT NEVER REACH IT ONLY WHEN WE HAVE ADMITTEDTHE CONCEPTION OF THE INFINITELY SMALL AND THE RESULTING GEOMETRICALPROGRESSION WITH A COMMON RATIO OF ONE TENTH AND HAVE FOUND THE SUM OFTHIS PROGRESSION TO INFINITY DO WE REACH A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMA MODERN BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS HAVING ACHIEVED THE ART OF DEALING WITHTHE INFINITELY SMALL CAN NOW YIELD SOLUTIONS IN OTHER MORE COMPLEXPROBLEMS OF MOTION WHICH USED TO APPEAR INSOLUBLETHIS MODERN BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS UNKNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS WHEN DEALINGWITH PROBLEMS OF MOTION ADMITS THE CONCEPTION OF THE INFINITELY SMALLAND SO CONFORMS TO THE CHIEF CONDITION OF MOTION ABSOLUTE CONTINUITYAND THEREBY CORRECTS THE INEVITABLE ERROR WHICH THE

SUM OF ALLTHOSE HUMAN WILLS MANS MIND POSTULATES ARBITRARY AND DISCONNECTEDUNITS THE FIRST METHOD OF HISTORY IS TO TAKE AN ARBITRARILY SELECTEDSERIES OF CONTINUOUS EVENTS AND EXAMINE IT APART FROM

THEIR CUSTOMARYPURSUITS HASTEN FROM ONE SIDE OF EUROPE TO THE OTHER PLUNDER ANDSLAUGHTER ONE ANOTHER TRIUMPH AND ARE PLUNGED IN DESPAIR AND FOR SOMEYEARS THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE IS ALTERED AND PRESENTS AN INTENSIVEMOVEMENT WHICH FIRST INCREASES AND THEN SLACKENS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OFTHIS MOVEMENT BY WHAT LAWS WAS IT GOVERNED ASKS THE MIND OF MANTHE HISTORIANS REPLYING TO THIS QUESTION LAY BEFORE US THE SAYINGS ANDDOINGS OF A FEW DOZEN MEN IN A BUILDING IN THE CITY OF PARIS CALLINGTHESE SAYINGS AND DOINGS THE REVOLUTION THEN THEY GIVE A DETAILEDBIOGRAPHY OF NAPOLEON AND OF CERTAIN PEOPLE FAVORABLE OR HOSTILE TO HIMTELL OF THE INFLUENCE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAD ON OTHERS AND SAY THATIS WHY THIS MOVEMENT TOOK PLACE AND THOSE ARE ITS LAWSBUT THE MIND OF MAN NOT ONLY REFUSES TO BELIEVE THIS EXPLANATION BUTPLAINLY SAYS THAT THIS METHOD OF EXPLANATION IS FALLACIOUS BECAUSE INIT A WEAKER PHENOMENON IS TAKEN AS THE CAUSE OF A STRONGER THE SUM OFHUMAN WILLS PRODUCED THE REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON AND ONLY THE SUM OFTHOSE WILLS FIRST TOLERATED AND THEN DESTROYED THEMBUT EVERY TIME THERE HAVE BEEN CONQUESTS THERE HAVE BEEN CONQUERORSEVERY TIME THERE HAS BEEN A REVOLUTION IN ANY STATE THERE HAVE BEENGREAT MEN SAYS HISTORY AND INDEED HUMAN REASON REPLIES EVERY TIMECONQUERORS APPEAR THERE HAVE BEEN WARS BUT THIS DOES NOT PROVE THAT THECONQUERORS CAUSED THE WARS AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND THE LAWS OF AWAR IN THE PERSONAL ACTIVITY OF A SINGLE MAN WHENEVER I LOOK AT MYWATCH AND ITS HANDS POINT TO TEN I HEAR THE BELLS OF THE NEIGHBORINGCHURCH BUT BECAUSE THE BELLS BEGIN TO RING WHEN THE HANDS OF THE CLOCKREACH TEN I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BELLS ISCAUSED BY THE POSITION OF THE HANDS OF THE WATCHWHENEVER I SEE THE MOVEMENT OF A LOCOMOTIVE I HEAR THE WHISTLE AND SEETHE VALVES OPENING AND WHEELS TURNING BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO CONCLUDETHAT THE WHISTLING AND THE TURNING OF WHEELS ARE THE CAUSE OF THEMOVEMENT OF THE ENGINETHE PEASANTS SAY THAT A COLD WIND BLOWS IN LATE SPRING BECAUSE THE OAKSARE BUDDING AND REALLY EVERY SPRING COLD WINDS DO BLOW WHEN THE OAK ISBUDDING BUT THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSES THE COLD WINDS TO BLOWWHEN THE OAK BUDS UNFOLD I CANNOT AGREE WITH THE PEASANTS THAT THEUNFOLDING OF THE OAK BUDS IS THE CAUSE OF THE COLD WIND FOR THE FORCEOF THE WIND IS BEYOND THE INFLUENCE OF THE BUDS I SEE ONLY ACOINCIDENCE OF OCCURRENCES SUCH AS HAPPENS WITH ALL THE PHENOMENA OFLIFE AND I SEE THAT HOWEVER MUCH AND HOWEVER CAREFULLY I OBSERVE THEHANDS OF THE WATCH AND THE VALVES AND WHEELS OF THE ENGINE AND THEOAK I SHALL NOT DISCOVER THE CAUSE OF THE BELLS RINGING THE ENGINEMOVING OR OF THE WINDS OF SPRING TO THAT I MUST ENTIRELY CHANGE MYPOINT OF VIEW AND STUDY THE LAWS OF THE MOVEMENT OF STEAM OF THE

KINGS MINISTERS AND GENERALS ANDSTUDY THE COMMON INFINITESIMALLY SMALL ELEMENTS BY WHICH THE MASSES AREMOVED NO ONE CAN SAY IN HOW FAR IT IS POSSIBLE FOR MAN TO ADVANCE INTHIS WAY TOWARD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAWS OF HISTORY BUT IT ISEVIDENT THAT ONLY ALONG THAT PATH DOES THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCOVERINGTHE LAWS OF HISTORY LIE AND THAT AS YET NOT A MILLIONTH PART AS MUCHMENTAL EFFORT HAS

THESITUATION OF MOSCOW AND MILITARY QUESTIONS GENERALLY THOUGH THEY HADNOT BEEN SUMMONED FOR THE PURPOSE AND THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO CALLED THEYALL FELT THAT THIS WAS REALLY A COUNCIL OF WAR THE CONVERSATIONS ALLDEALT WITH PUBLIC QUESTIONS IF ANYONE GAVE OR ASKED FOR PERSONAL NEWSIT WAS DONE IN A WHISPER AND THEY IMMEDIATELY REVERTED TO GENERALMATTERS NO JOKES OR LAUGHTER OR SMILES EVEN WERE SEEN AMONG ALLTHESE MEN THEY EVIDENTLY ALL MADE AN EFFORT TO HOLD THEMSELVES AT THEHEIGHT THE SITUATION DEMANDED AND ALL THESE GROUPS WHILE TALKING AMONGTHEMSELVES TRIED TO KEEP NEAR THE COMMANDERINCHIEF WHOSE BENCHFORMED THE CENTER OF THE GATHERING AND TO SPEAK SO THAT HE MIGHTOVERHEAR THEM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF LISTENED TO WHAT WAS BEING SAIDAND SOMETIMES ASKED THEM TO REPEAT THEIR REMARKS BUT DID NOT HIMSELFTAKE PART IN THE CONVERSATIONS OR EXPRESS ANY OPINION AFTER HEARINGWHAT WAS BEING SAID BY ONE OR OTHER OF THESE GROUPS HE GENERALLY TURNEDAWAY WITH AN AIR OF DISAPPOINTMENT AS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT SPEAKING OFANYTHING HE WISHED TO HEAR SOME DISCUSSED THE POSITION THAT HAD BEENCHOSEN CRITICIZING NOT THE POSITION ITSELF SO MUCH AS THE MENTALCAPACITY OF THOSE WHO HAD CHOSEN

DIRECTION THE TROOPS WOULD NOW HAVE TO TAKE A SIXTH GROUPWAS TALKING ABSOLUTE NONSENSE KUTUZOVS EXPRESSION GREW MORE AND MOREPREOCCUPIED AND GLOOMY FROM ALL THIS TALK HE SAW ONLY ONE THING THATTO DEFEND MOSCOW WAS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE FULL MEANING OFTHOSE WORDS THAT IS TO SAY SO UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT IF ANY SENSELESSCOMMANDER WERE TO GIVE ORDERS TO FIGHT CONFUSION WOULD RESULT BUT THEBATTLE WOULD STILL NOT TAKE PLACE IT WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THECOMMANDERS NOT MERELY ALL RECOGNIZED THE POSITION TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BUTIN THEIR CONVERSATIONS WERE ONLY DISCUSSING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER ITSINEVITABLE ABANDONMENT HOW COULD THE COMMANDERS LEAD THEIR TROOPS TO AFIELD OF BATTLE THEY CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THE LOWERGRADEOFFICERS AND EVEN THE SOLDIERS WHO TOO REASON ALSO CONSIDERED THEPOSITION IMPOSSIBLE AND THEREFORE COULD NOT GO TO FIGHT FULLY CONVINCEDAS THEY WERE OF DEFEAT IF BENNIGSEN INSISTED ON THE POSITION BEINGDEFENDED AND OTHERS STILL DISCUSSED IT THE QUESTION WAS NO LONGERIMPORTANT IN ITSELF BUT ONLY AS A PRETEXT FOR DISPUTES AND INTRIGUETHIS KUTUZOV KNEW WELLBENNIGSEN WHO HAD CHOSEN THE POSITION WARMLY DISPLAYED HIS RUSSIANPATRIOTISM KUTUZOV COULD NOT LISTEN TO THIS WITHOUT WINCING BYINSISTING THAT MOSCOW MUST BE DEFENDED HIS AIM WAS AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHTTO KUTUZOV IF THE DEFENSE FAILED TO THROW THE BLAME ON KUTUZOV WHO HADBROUGHT THE ARMY AS FAR AS THE SPARROW HILLS WITHOUT GIVING BATTLE IFIT SUCCEEDED TO CLAIM THE SUCCESS AS HIS OWN OR IF BATTLE WERE NOTGIVEN TO CLEAR HIMSELF OF THE CRIME OF ABANDONING MOSCOW BUT THISINTRIGUE DID NOT NOW OCCUPY THE OLD MANS MIND ONE TERRIBLE QUESTIONABSORBED HIM AND TO THAT QUESTION HE HEARD NO REPLY FROM ANYONE THEQUESTION FOR HIM NOW WAS HAVE I REALLY ALLOWED NAPOLEON TO REACHMOSCOW AND WHEN DID I DO SO WHEN WAS IT DECIDED CAN IT HAVE BEENYESTERDAY WHEN I ORDERED PLATOV TO RETREAT OR WAS IT THE EVENINGBEFORE WHEN I HAD A NAP AND TOLD BENNIGSEN TO ISSUE ORDERS OR WAS ITEARLIER STILL WHEN WHEN WAS THIS TERRIBLE AFFAIR DECIDED MOSCOWMUST BE ABANDONED THE ARMY MUST RETREAT AND THE ORDER TO DO SO MUST BEGIVEN TO GIVE THAT TERRIBLE ORDER SEEMED TO HIM EQUIVALENT TORESIGNING THE COMMAND OF THE

AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT MANNER FROM KUTUZOVAFTER THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THE ABANDONMENT AND BURNING OF MOSCOW WASAS INEVITABLE AS THE RETREAT OF THE ARMY BEYOND MOSCOW WITHOUT FIGHTINGEVERY RUSSIAN

BEGINNING WITH SMOLENSK WITHOUT THEPARTICIPATION OF COUNT ROSTOPCHIN AND HIS BROADSHEETS THE PEOPLEAWAITED THE ENEMY UNCONCERNEDLY DID NOT RIOT OR BECOME EXCITED OR TEARANYONE TO PIECES BUT FACED ITS

REMAINED AND BURNED AND DESTROYED WHAT WAS LEFTTHE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS WOULD BE SO AND WOULD ALWAYS BE SO WAS ANDIS PRESENT IN THE HEART OF EVERY RUSSIAN AND A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THISAND A

AND WAS AWAKENED SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT BY A COURIERBRINGING HIM A LETTER FROM KUTUZOV THIS LETTER REQUESTED THE COUNT TOSEND POLICE OFFICERS TO GUIDE THE TROOPS THROUGH THE TOWN AS THE ARMYWAS RETREATING TO THE RYAZAN ROAD BEYOND MOSCOW THIS WAS NOT NEWS TOROSTOPCHIN HE HAD KNOWN THAT MOSCOW WOULD BE ABANDONED NOT MERELY SINCEHIS INTERVIEW THE PREVIOUS DAY WITH KUTUZOV ON THE POKLONNY HILL BUTEVER SINCE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOR ALL THE GENERALS WHO CAME TOMOSCOW AFTER THAT BATTLE HAD SAID UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TOFIGHT ANOTHER BATTLE AND SINCE THEN THE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY HAD BEENREMOVED EVERY NIGHT AND HALF THE INHABITANTS HAD LEFT THE CITY WITHROSTOPCHINS OWN PERMISSION YET ALL THE SAME THIS INFORMATIONASTONISHED AND IRRITATED THE COUNT COMING AS IT DID IN THE FORM OF ASIMPLE NOTE WITH AN ORDER FROM KUTUZOV AND RECEIVED AT NIGHT BREAKINGIN ON HIS BEAUTY SLEEPWHEN LATER ON IN HIS MEMOIRS COUNT ROSTOPCHIN EXPLAINED HIS ACTIONS ATTHIS TIME HE REPEATEDLY SAYS THAT HE WAS THEN ACTUATED BY TWO IMPORTANTCONSIDERATIONS TO MAINTAIN TRANQUILLITY IN MOSCOW AND EXPEDITE THEDEPARTURE OF THE INHABITANTS IF ONE ACCEPTS THIS TWOFOLD AIM ALLROSTOPCHINS ACTIONS APPEAR IRREPROACHABLE WHY WERE THE HOLY RELICSTHE ARMS AMMUNITION GUNPOWDER AND STORES OF CORN NOT REMOVED WHYWERE THOUSANDS OF INHABITANTS DECEIVED INTO BELIEVING THAT MOSCOW WOULDNOT BE GIVEN UPAND THEREBY RUINED TO PRESERVE THE TRANQUILLITY OFTHE CITY EXPLAINS COUNT ROSTOPCHIN WHY WERE BUNDLES OF USELESSPAPERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND LEPPICHS BALLOON AND OTHERARTICLES REMOVED TO LEAVE THE TOWN EMPTY EXPLAINS COUNT ROSTOPCHINONE NEED ONLY ADMIT THAT PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY IS IN DANGER AND ANY ACTIONFINDS A JUSTIFICATIONALL THE HORRORS OF THE REIGN OF TERROR WERE BASED ONLY ON SOLICITUDE

LEAVING IT AND THERETREATING TROOPS WERE FILLING IT WHY SHOULD THAT CAUSE THE MASSES TORIOTNEITHER IN MOSCOW NOR ANYWHERE IN RUSSIA DID ANYTHING RESEMBLING ANINSURRECTION EVER OCCUR WHEN THE ENEMY ENTERED A TOWN MORE THAN TENTHOUSAND PEOPLE WERE STILL IN MOSCOW ON THE FIRST AND SECOND OFSEPTEMBER AND EXCEPT FOR A MOB IN THE GOVERNORS COURTYARD ASSEMBLEDTHERE AT HIS BIDDING NOTHING HAPPENED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE WOULDHAVE BEEN EVEN LESS REASON TO EXPECT A DISTURBANCE AMONG THE PEOPLE IFAFTER THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WHEN THE SURRENDER OF MOSCOW BECAMECERTAIN OR AT LEAST PROBABLE ROSTOPCHIN INSTEAD OF EXCITING THE PEOPLEBY DISTRIBUTING ARMS AND BROADSHEETS HAD TAKEN STEPS TO REMOVE ALL THEHOLY RELICS THE GUNPOWDER MUNITIONS AND MONEY AND HAD TOLD THEPOPULATION PLAINLY THAT THE TOWN WOULD BE ABANDONEDROSTOPCHIN THOUGH HE HAD PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS WAS A SANGUINE ANDIMPULSIVE MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS MOVED IN THE HIGHEST ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCLESAND HAD NO UNDERSTANDING AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE HE SUPPOSED HIMSELF TO BEGUIDING EVER SINCE THE ENEMYS ENTRY INTO SMOLENSK HE HAD INIMAGINATION BEEN PLAYING THE ROLE OF DIRECTOR OF THE POPULAR FEELING OFTHE HEART OF RUSSIA NOT ONLY DID IT SEEM TO HIM AS TO ALLADMINISTRATORS THAT HE CONTROLLED THE EXTERNAL ACTIONS OF MOSCOWSINHABITANTS BUT HE ALSO THOUGHT HE CONTROLLED THEIR MENTAL ATTITUDE BYMEANS OF HIS BROADSHEETS AND POSTERS WRITTEN IN A COARSE TONE WHICH THEPEOPLE DESPISE IN THEIR OWN CLASS AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND FROM THOSE INAUTHORITY ROSTOPCHIN WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE FINE ROLE OF LEADER OFPOPULAR FEELING AND HAD GROWN SO USED TO IT THAT THE NECESSITY OFRELINQUISHING THAT ROLE AND ABANDONING MOSCOW WITHOUT ANY HEROIC DISPLAYTOOK HIM UNAWARES AND HE SUDDENLY FELT THE GROUND SLIP AWAY FROM UNDERHIS FEET SO THAT HE POSITIVELY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO THOUGH HE KNEWIT WAS COMING HE DID NOT TILL THE LAST MOMENT WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVETHAT MOSCOW WOULD BE ABANDONED AND DID NOT PREPARE FOR IT THEINHABITANTS LEFT AGAINST HIS WISHES IF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES WEREREMOVED THIS WAS ONLY DONE ON THE DEMAND OF OFFICIALS TO WHOM THE COUNTYIELDED RELUCTANTLY HE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ROLE HE HAD CREATED FORHIMSELF AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH

WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE DUSTY WRITING TABLEIN THE DEATHLIKE STILLNESS OF THE STUDY CALM AND SIGNIFICANT MEMORIESOF THE LAST FEW DAYS ROSE ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATIONPARTICULARLY OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND OF THAT VAGUE SENSE OF HISOWN INSIGNIFICANCE AND INSINCERITY COMPARED WITH THE TRUTH SIMPLICITYAND STRENGTH OF THE CLASS OF MEN HE MENTALLY CLASSED AS THEY WHENGERASIM ROUSED HIM FROM HIS REVERIE THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM OF TAKINGPART IN THE POPULAR DEFENSE OF MOSCOW WHICH HE KNEW WAS PROJECTED ANDWITH THAT OBJECT HE HAD ASKED GERASIM TO GET HIM A PEASANTS COAT AND APISTOL

SALVATION OF EUROPEWITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD THE EMPEROR DISMISSED HIMCHAPTER IVIT IS NATURAL FOR US WHO WERE NOT LIVING IN THOSE DAYS TO IMAGINE THATWHEN HALF RUSSIA HAD BEEN CONQUERED AND THE INHABITANTS WERE FLEEING TODISTANT PROVINCES AND ONE LEVY AFTER ANOTHER WAS BEING RAISED FOR THEDEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND ALL RUSSIANS FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEASTWERE SOLELY ENGAGED IN SACRIFICING THEMSELVES SAVING THEIR FATHERLANDOR WEEPING OVER ITS DOWNFALL THE TALES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THAT TIMEWITHOUT EXCEPTION SPEAK ONLY OF THE SELFSACRIFICE PATRIOTIC DEVOTIONDESPAIR GRIEF AND THE HEROISM OF THE RUSSIANS BUT IT WAS NOT REALLYSO IT APPEARS SO TO US BECAUSE WE SEE ONLY THE GENERAL HISTORICINTEREST OF THAT TIME AND DO NOT SEE ALL THE PERSONAL HUMAN INTERESTSTHAT PEOPLE HAD YET IN REALITY THOSE PERSONAL INTERESTS OF THE MOMENTSO MUCH TRANSCEND THE GENERAL INTERESTS THAT THEY ALWAYS PREVENT THEPUBLIC INTEREST FROM BEING FELT OR EVEN NOTICED MOST OF THE PEOPLE ATTHAT TIME PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF EVENTS BUT WEREGUIDED ONLY BY THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS AND THEY WERE THE VERY PEOPLEWHOSE ACTIVITIES AT THAT PERIOD WERE MOST USEFULTHOSE WHO TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND TO TAKEPART IN IT BY SELFSACRIFICE AND HEROISM WERE THE MOST USELESS MEMBERSOF SOCIETY THEY SAW EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL THEY DID FOR THECOMMON GOOD TURNED OUT TO BE USELESS AND FOOLISHLIKE PIERRES ANDMAMONOVS REGIMENTS WHICH LOOTED RUSSIAN VILLAGES AND THE LINT THEYOUNG LADIES PREPARED AND THAT NEVER REACHED THE WOUNDED AND SO ONEVEN THOSE FOND OF INTELLECTUAL TALK AND OF EXPRESSING THEIR FEELINGSWHO DISCUSSED RUSSIAS POSITION AT THE TIME INVOLUNTARILY INTRODUCEDINTO THEIR CONVERSATION EITHER A SHADE OF PRETENSE AND FALSEHOOD ORUSELESS CONDEMNATION AND ANGER DIRECTED AGAINST PEOPLE ACCUSED OFACTIONS NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY BE GUILTY OF IN HISTORIC EVENTS THE RULEFORBIDDING US TO EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE IS SPECIALLYAPPLICABLE ONLY UNCONSCIOUS ACTION BEARS FRUIT AND HE WHO PLAYS A PARTIN AN HISTORIC EVENT NEVER UNDERSTANDS ITS SIGNIFICANCE IF HE TRIES TOREALIZE IT HIS EFFORTS ARE FRUITLESSTHE MORE CLOSELY A MAN WAS ENGAGED IN THE EVENTS THEN TAKING PLACE INRUSSIA THE LESS DID HE REALIZE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN PETERSBURG AND INTHE PROVINCES AT A DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN INMILITIA UNIFORMS WEPT FOR RUSSIA AND ITS ANCIENT CAPITAL AND TALKED OFSELFSACRIFICE AND SO ON BUT IN THE ARMY WHICH RETIRED BEYOND MOSCOWTHERE WAS LITTLE TALK OR THOUGHT OF MOSCOW AND WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHTOF

NICHOLAS ROSTOV TOOK A CLOSEAND PROLONGED PART IN THE DEFENSE OF HIS COUNTRY BUT DID SO CASUALLYWITHOUT ANY AIM AT SELFSACRIFICE AND HE THEREFORE LOOKED AT WHAT WASGOING ON IN RUSSIA WITHOUT DESPAIR AND WITHOUT DISMALLY RACKING HISBRAINS OVER IT HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE STATE OFRUSSIA HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUTIT THAT KUTUZOV AND OTHERS WERE THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT THAT HE HADHEARD THAT THE REGIMENTS WERE TO BE MADE UP TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH THATFIGHTING WOULD PROBABLY GO ON FOR A LONG TIME YET AND THAT THINGS BEINGSO IT WAS QUITE LIKELY HE MIGHT BE IN COMMAND OF A REGIMENT IN A COUPLEOF YEARS TIMEAS HE LOOKED AT THE MATTER IN THIS WAY HE LEARNED THAT HE WAS BEINGSENT TO VORONEZH TO BUY REMOUNTS FOR HIS DIVISION NOT ONLY WITHOUTREGRET AT BEING PREVENTED FROM TAKING PART IN THE COMING BATTLE BUTWITH THE GREATEST PLEASUREWHICH HE DID NOT CONCEAL AND WHICH HISCOMRADES FULLY UNDERSTOODA FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF

DESPITE ITS FINE ROUNDED WRINKLES HAD AN EXPRESSION OFINNOCENCE AND YOUTH HIS VOICE WAS PLEASANT AND MUSICAL BUT THE CHIEFPECULIARITY OF HIS SPEECH WAS ITS DIRECTNESS AND APPOSITENESS IT WASEVIDENT THAT HE NEVER CONSIDERED WHAT HE HAD SAID OR WAS GOING TO SAYAND CONSEQUENTLY THE RAPIDITY AND JUSTICE OF HIS INTONATION HAD ANIRRESISTIBLE PERSUASIVENESSHIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND AGILITY DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF HISIMPRISONMENT WERE SUCH THAT HE SEEMED NOT TO KNOW WHAT FATIGUE ANDSICKNESS MEANT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE LYING DOWN HE SAID LORD LAY MEDOWN AS A STONE AND RAISE ME UP AS A LOAF AND EVERY

AND WITH FOLK SAYINGS WHICHPIERRE THOUGHT HE INVENTED HIMSELF BUT THE CHIEF CHARM OF HIS TALK LAYIN THE FACT THAT THE COMMONEST EVENTSSOMETIMES JUST SUCH AS PIERRE HADWITNESSED WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE OF THEMASSUMED IN KARATAEVS ACHARACTER OF SOLEMN FITNESS HE LIKED TO HEAR THE FOLK TALES ONE OF THESOLDIERS USED TO TELL OF AN EVENING THEY WERE ALWAYS THE SAME BUTMOST OF ALL HE LIKED TO HEAR STORIES

ONLY DID PRINCE ANDREW KNOW HE WOULD DIE BUT HE FELT THAT HE WASDYING AND WAS ALREADY HALF DEAD HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN ALOOFNESS FROMEVERYTHING EARTHLY AND A STRANGE AND JOYOUS LIGHTNESS OF

STRANGELIGHTNESS HE EXPERIENCED ALMOST COMPREHENSIBLE AND PALPABLEFORMERLY HE HAD FEARED THE END HE HAD TWICE EXPERIENCED THAT TERRIBLYTORMENTING FEAR OF DEATHTHE ENDBUT NOW HE NO LONGER UNDERSTOOD THATFEARHE HAD FELT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE SHELL SPUN LIKE A TOP BEFOREHIM AND HE LOOKED AT THE FALLOW FIELD THE BUSHES AND THE SKY ANDKNEW THAT HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH DEATH WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF AFTERBEING WOUNDED AND THE FLOWER OF ETERNAL UNFETTERED LOVE HAD INSTANTLYUNFOLDED ITSELF IN HIS SOUL AS IF FREED FROM THE BONDAGE OF LIFE THATHAD RESTRAINED IT HE NO LONGER FEARED DEATH AND CEASED TO THINK ABOUTITDURING THE HOURS OF SOLITUDE SUFFERING AND PARTIAL DELIRIUM HE SPENTAFTER HE WAS WOUNDED THE MORE DEEPLY HE PENETRATED INTO THE NEWPRINCIPLE OF ETERNAL LOVE REVEALED TO HIM THE MORE HE UNCONSCIOUSLYDETACHED HIMSELF FROM EARTHLY LIFE TO LOVE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ANDALWAYS TO SACRIFICE ONESELF FOR LOVE MEANT NOT TO LOVE ANYONE NOT TOLIVE THIS EARTHLY LIFE AND THE MORE

DURING THOSE FIRST DAYS HEREMEMBERED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DIE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WELL WHAT OFIT SO MUCH THE BETTERBUT AFTER THE NIGHT IN MYTISHCHI WHEN HALF DELIRIOUS HE HAD SEEN HERFOR WHOM HE LONGED APPEAR BEFORE HIM AND HAVING PRESSED HER HAND TO HISLIPS HAD SHED GENTLE HAPPY TEARS LOVE FOR A PARTICULAR WOMAN AGAINCREPT UNOBSERVED INTO HIS HEART AND ONCE MORE BOUND HIM TO LIFE ANDJOYFUL

QUESTIONWHETHER KURAGIN WAS ALIVE AND HE DARED NOT INQUIREHIS ILLNESS PURSUED ITS NORMAL PHYSICAL COURSE BUT WHAT NATASHAREFERRED TO WHEN SHE SAID THIS SUDDENLY HAPPENED HAD OCCURRED TWODAYS BEFORE PRINCESS MARY ARRIVED IT WAS THE LAST SPIRITUAL STRUGGLEBETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IN WHICH DEATH GAINED THE VICTORY IT WAS THEUNEXPECTED REALIZATION OF THE FACT THAT HE STILL VALUED LIFE ASPRESENTED TO HIM IN THE FORM OF HIS LOVE FOR NATASHA AND A LAST THOUGHULTIMATELY VANQUISHED ATTACK OF TERROR BEFORE THE UNKNOWNIT WAS EVENING AS USUAL AFTER DINNER HE WAS SLIGHTLY FEVERISH AND HISTHOUGHTS WERE

ANDINSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE APPEARED BEFORE HIM HE TALKED TO THEM ANDDISCUSSED SOMETHING TRIVIAL THEY WERE PREPARING TO GO AWAY SOMEWHEREPRINCE ANDREW DIMLY REALIZED THAT ALL THIS WAS TRIVIAL AND THAT HE HADMORE IMPORTANT CARES BUT HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK SURPRISING THEM BYEMPTY WITTICISMS GRADUALLY UNNOTICED ALL THESE PERSONS BEGAN TODISAPPEAR AND A SINGLE QUESTION THAT OF THE CLOSED DOOR SUPERSEDED ALLELSE HE ROSE AND WENT TO THE DOOR TO BOLT AND LOCK IT EVERYTHINGDEPENDED ON WHETHER HE WAS OR WAS NOT IN TIME TO LOCK IT HE WENT ANDTRIED TO HURRY BUT HIS LEGS REFUSED TO MOVE AND HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT BEIN TIME TO LOCK THE DOOR THOUGH HE PAINFULLY STRAINED ALL HIS POWERS HEWAS SEIZED BY AN AGONIZING FEAR AND THAT FEAR WAS THE FEAR OF DEATH ITSTOOD BEHIND THE DOOR BUT JUST WHEN HE WAS CLUMSILY CREEPING TOWARD THEDOOR THAT DREADFUL SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS ALREADY PRESSINGAGAINST IT AND FORCING ITS WAY IN SOMETHING NOT HUMANDEATHWASBREAKING IN THROUGH THAT DOOR AND HAD TO BE KEPT OUT HE SEIZED THEDOOR MAKING A FINAL EFFORT TO HOLD IT BACKTO LOCK IT WAS NO LONGERPOSSIBLEBUT HIS EFFORTS WERE WEAK AND CLUMSY AND THE DOOR PUSHED FROMBEHIND BY THAT TERROR OPENED AND CLOSED AGAINONCE AGAIN IT PUSHED FROM OUTSIDE HIS LAST SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS WERE VAINAND BOTH HALVES OF THE DOOR NOISELESSLY OPENED IT ENTERED AND IT WASDEATH AND PRINCE ANDREW DIEDBUT AT THE INSTANT HE DIED PRINCE

AND THE VEIL THAT HAD TILLTHEN CONCEALED THE UNKNOWN WAS LIFTED FROM HIS SPIRITUAL VISION HE FELTAS IF POWERS TILL THEN CONFINED WITHIN HIM HAD BEEN LIBERATED AND THATSTRANGE LIGHTNESS DID NOT AGAIN LEAVE HIMWHEN WAKING IN A COLD PERSPIRATION HE MOVED ON THE DIVAN NATASHA WENTUP AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER HE DID NOT ANSWER AND LOOKED ATHER STRANGELY NOT UNDERSTANDINGTHAT WAS WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE PRINCESS MARYSARRIVAL FROM THAT DAY AS THE DOCTOR EXPRESSED IT THE WASTING FEVERASSUMED A MALIGNANT CHARACTER BUT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID DID NOT INTERESTNATASHA SHE SAW THE TERRIBLE MORAL SYMPTOMS WHICH TO HER WERE MORECONVINCINGFROM THAT DAY AN AWAKENING FROM LIFE CAME TO PRINCE ANDREW TOGETHER WITHHIS AWAKENING FROM SLEEP AND COMPARED TO THE DURATION OF LIFE IT DIDNOT SEEM TO HIM SLOWER THAN AN AWAKENING FROM SLEEP COMPARED TO THEDURATION OF A DREAMTHERE WAS NOTHING TERRIBLE OR VIOLENT IN THIS COMPARATIVELY SLOWAWAKENINGHIS LAST DAYS AND HOURS PASSED IN AN ORDINARY AND SIMPLE WAY BOTHPRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA WHO DID NOT LEAVE HIM FELT THIS THEY DIDNOT WEEP OR SHUDDER AND DURING THESE LAST DAYS THEY THEMSELVES FELT THATTHEY WERE NOT ATTENDING ON HIM HE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE HAD LEFTTHEM BUT ON WHAT REMINDED THEM MOST CLOSELY OF HIMHIS BODY BOTH FELTTHIS SO STRONGLY THAT THE OUTWARD AND TERRIBLE SIDE OF DEATH DID NOTAFFECT THEM AND THEY DID NOT FEEL IT NECESSARY TO FOMENT THEIR GRIEFNEITHER IN HIS PRESENCE NOR OUT OF IT DID THEY WEEP NOR DID THEY EVERTALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT HIM THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD NOT EXPRESS INWORDS WHAT THEY UNDERSTOODTHEY BOTH SAW THAT HE WAS SINKING SLOWLY AND QUIETLY DEEPER AND DEEPERAWAY FROM THEM AND THEY BOTH KNEW THAT THIS HAD TO BE SO AND THAT ITWAS RIGHTHE CONFESSED AND RECEIVED COMMUNION EVERYONE CAME TO TAKE LEAVE OFHIM WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIS SON TO HIM HE PRESSED HIS LIPS TO THE BOYSAND TURNED AWAY NOT BECAUSE HE FELT IT HARD AND SAD PRINCESS MARY ANDNATASHA UNDERSTOOD THAT BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THATWAS REQUIRED OF HIM BUT WHEN THEY TOLD HIM TO BLESS THE BOY HE DIDWHAT WAS DEMANDED AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF ASKING WHETHER THERE WASANYTHING ELSE HE SHOULD DOWHEN THE LAST CONVULSIONS OF THE BODY WHICH THE SPIRIT WAS LEAVINGOCCURRED PRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA WERE PRESENTIS IT OVER SAID PRINCESS MARY WHEN HIS BODY HAD FOR A FEW MINUTESLAIN MOTIONLESS GROWING COLD BEFORE THEM NATASHA WENT UP LOOKED ATTHE DEAD EYES AND HASTENED TO CLOSE THEM SHE CLOSED THEM BUT DID NOTKISS THEM BUT CLUNG TO THAT WHICH REMINDED HER MOST NEARLY OF HIMHISBODYWHERE HAS HE GONE WHERE IS HE NOWWHEN THE BODY WASHED AND DRESSED LAY IN THE COFFIN ON A TABLEEVERYONE CAME TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIM AND THEY ALL WEPTLITTLE NICHOLAS CRIED BECAUSE HIS HEART WAS RENT BY PAINFUL PERPLEXITYTHE COUNTESS AND SONYA CRIED FROM PITY FOR NATASHA AND BECAUSE HE WAS NOMORE THE OLD COUNT CRIED BECAUSE HE FELT THAT BEFORE LONG HE TOOMUST TAKE THE SAME TERRIBLE STEPNATASHA AND PRINCESS MARY ALSO WEPT NOW BUT NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWNPERSONAL GRIEF THEY WEPT WITH A REVERENT AND SOFTENING EMOTION WHICHHAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEIR SOULS AT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SIMPLEAND SOLEMN MYSTERY OF DEATH THAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THEIRPRESENCEBOOK THIRTEEN CHAPTER IMANS MIND CANNOT GRASP THE CAUSES OF EVENTS IN THEIR COMPLETENESS BUTTHE DESIRE TO FIND THOSE CAUSES IS IMPLANTED IN MANS SOUL AND WITHOUTCONSIDERING THE MULTIPLICITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONDITIONS ANY ONE OFWHICH TAKEN SEPARATELY MAY SEEM TO BE THE CAUSE HE SNATCHES AT THEFIRST APPROXIMATION TO A CAUSE THAT SEEMS TO HIM INTELLIGIBLE AND SAYSTHIS IS THE CAUSE IN HISTORICAL EVENTS WHERE THE ACTIONS OF MEN ARETHE SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION THE FIRST AND MOST PRIMITIVE APPROXIMATIONTO PRESENT ITSELF WAS THE WILL OF THE GODS AND AFTER THAT THE WILL OFTHOSE WHO STOOD IN THE MOST PROMINENT POSITIONTHE HEROES OF HISTORYBUT WE NEED ONLY PENETRATE TO THE ESSENCE OF ANY HISTORIC EVENTWHICHLIES IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE GENERAL MASS OF MEN WHO TAKE PART IN ITTOBE CONVINCED THAT THE WILL OF THE HISTORIC HERO DOES NOT CONTROL THEACTIONS OF THE MASS BUT IS ITSELF CONTINUALLY CONTROLLED IT MAY SEEM TOBE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE WHETHER WE UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OFHISTORICAL EVENTS THIS WAY OR THAT YET THERE IS THE SAME DIFFERENCEBETWEEN A MAN WHO SAYS THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST MOVED ON THE EASTBECAUSE NAPOLEON WISHED IT AND A MAN WHO SAYS THAT THIS HAPPENED BECAUSEIT HAD TO HAPPEN AS THERE IS BETWEEN THOSE WHO DECLARED THAT THE EARTHWAS STATIONARY AND THAT THE PLANETS MOVED ROUND IT AND THOSE WHOADMITTED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT UPHELD THE EARTH BUT KNEW THEREWERE LAWS DIRECTING ITS MOVEMENT AND THAT OF THE OTHER PLANETS THEREIS AND CAN BE NO CAUSE OF AN HISTORICAL EVENT EXCEPT THE ONE CAUSE OFALL CAUSES BUT THERE ARE LAWS DIRECTING EVENTS AND SOME OF THESE LAWSARE KNOWN TO US WHILE WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF OTHERS WE CANNOT COMPREHENDTHE DISCOVERY OF THESE LAWS IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE QUITEABANDONED THE ATTEMPT TO FIND THE CAUSE IN THE WILL OF SOME ONE MANJUST AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS WASPOSSIBLE ONLY WHEN MEN ABANDONED THE CONCEPTION OF THE FIXITY OF THEEARTHTHE HISTORIANS CONSIDER THAT NEXT TO THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THEOCCUPATION OF MOSCOW BY THE ENEMY AND ITS DESTRUCTION BY FIRE THE MOSTIMPORTANT EPISODE OF THE WAR OF  WAS THE MOVEMENT OF THE RUSSIANARMY FROM THE RYAZANA TO THE KALUGA ROAD AND TO THE TARUTINO CAMPTHESOCALLED FLANK MARCH ACROSS THE KRASNAYA PAKHRA RIVER THEY ASCRIBE THEGLORY OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT OF GENIUS TO DIFFERENT MEN AND DISPUTE AS TOWHOM THE HONOR IS DUE EVEN FOREIGN HISTORIANS INCLUDING THE FRENCHACKNOWLEDGE THE GENIUS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS WHEN THEY SPEAK OF THATFLANK MARCH BUT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY MILITARY WRITERS ANDFOLLOWING THEM OTHERS CONSIDER THIS FLANK MARCH TO BE THE PROFOUNDCONCEPTION OF SOME ONE MAN WHO SAVED RUSSIA AND DESTROYED NAPOLEON INTHE FIRST PLACE IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PROFUNDITY AND GENIUSOF THIS MOVEMENT LAY FOR NOT MUCH MENTAL EFFORT WAS NEEDED TO SEE THATTHE BEST POSITION FOR AN ARMY WHEN IT IS NOT BEING ATTACKED IS WHERETHERE ARE MOST PROVISIONS AND EVEN A DULL BOY OF THIRTEEN COULD HAVEGUESSED THAT THE BEST POSITION FOR AN ARMY AFTER ITS RETREAT FROM MOSCOWIN  WAS ON THE KALUGA ROAD SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND BYWHAT REASONING THE HISTORIANS REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS MANEUVERWAS A PROFOUND ONE AND IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND JUST WHYTHEY THINK THAT THIS MANEUVER WAS CALCULATED TO SAVE RUSSIA AND DESTROYTHE FRENCH FOR THIS FLANK MARCH HAD IT BEEN PRECEDED ACCOMPANIED ORFOLLOWED BY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE PROVED RUINOUS TO THERUSSIANS AND SALUTARY FOR THE FRENCH IF THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANARMY REALLY BEGAN TO IMPROVE FROM THE TIME OF THAT MARCH IT DOES NOT ATALL FOLLOW THAT THE MARCH WAS THE CAUSE OF ITTHAT FLANK MARCH MIGHT NOT ONLY HAVE FAILED TO GIVE ANY ADVANTAGE TO THERUSSIAN ARMY BUT MIGHT IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE LED TO ITSDESTRUCTION WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD MOSCOW NOT BURNED DOWN IFMURAT HAD NOT LOST SIGHT OF THE RUSSIANS IF NAPOLEON HAD NOT REMAINEDINACTIVE IF THE RUSSIAN ARMY AT KRASNAYA PAKHRA HAD GIVEN BATTLE ASBENNIGSEN AND BARCLAY ADVISED WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THE FRENCHATTACKED THE RUSSIANS WHILE THEY WERE MARCHING BEYOND THE PAKHRA WHATWOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF ON APPROACHING TARUTINO NAPOLEON HAD ATTACKEDTHE RUSSIANS WITH BUT A TENTH OF THE ENERGY HE HAD SHOWN WHEN HEATTACKED THEM AT SMOLENSK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THE FRENCH MOVEDON PETERSBURG IN ANY OF THESE EVENTUALITIES THE FLANK MARCH THATBROUGHT SALVATION MIGHT HAVE PROVED DISASTROUSTHE THIRD AND MOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT PEOPLE STUDYINGHISTORY DELIBERATELY AVOID SEEING THAT THIS FLANK MARCH CANNOT BEATTRIBUTED TO ANY ONE MAN THAT NO ONE EVER FORESAW IT AND THAT INREALITY LIKE THE RETREAT FROM FILI IT DID NOT SUGGEST ITSELF TO ANYONEIN ITS ENTIRETY BUT RESULTEDMOMENT BY MOMENT STEP BY STEP EVENT BYEVENTFROM AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF MOST DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WAS ONLYSEEN IN ITS ENTIRETY WHEN IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND BELONGED TO THEPASTAT THE COUNCIL AT FILI THE PREVAILING THOUGHT IN THE MINDS OF THERUSSIAN COMMANDERS WAS THE ONE NATURALLY SUGGESTING ITSELF NAMELY ADIRECT RETREAT BY THE NIZHNI ROAD IN PROOF OF THIS THERE IS THE FACTTHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL VOTED FOR SUCH A RETREAT AND ABOVE ALLTHERE IS THE WELLKNOWN CONVERSATION AFTER THE COUNCIL BETWEEN THECOMMANDER IN CHIEF AND LANSKOY WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE COMMISSARIATDEPARTMENT LANSKOY INFORMED THE COMMANDERINCHIEF THAT THE ARMYSUPPLIES WERE FOR THE MOST PART STORED ALONG THE OKA IN THE TULA ANDRYAZAN PROVINCES AND THAT IF THEY RETREATED ON NIZHNI THE ARMY WOULD BESEPARATED FROM ITS SUPPLIES BY THE BROAD RIVER OKA WHICH CANNOT BECROSSED EARLY IN WINTER THIS WAS THE FIRST INDICATION OF THE NECESSITYOF DEVIATING FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEMED THE MOST NATURAL COURSEADIRECT RETREAT ON NIZHNINOVGOROD THE ARMY TURNED MORE TO THE SOUTHALONG THE RYAZAN ROAD AND NEARER TO ITS SUPPLIES SUBSEQUENTLY THEINACTIVITY OF THE FRENCH WHO EVEN LOST SIGHT OF

OVER BY A FORCEDMARCH TO THE TULA ROAD BEYOND THE PAKHRA THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERSINTENDED TO REMAIN AT PODOLSK AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF THE TARUTINOPOSITION BUT INNUMERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE REAPPEARANCE OF FRENCHTROOPS WHO HAD FOR A TIME LOST TOUCH WITH THE RUSSIANS AND PROJECTS OFGIVING BATTLE AND ABOVE ALL THE ABUNDANCE OF PROVISIONS IN KALUGAPROVINCE OBLIGED OUR ARMY TO TURN STILL MORE TO THE SOUTH AND TO CROSSFROM THE TULA TO THE KALUGA ROAD AND GO TO TARUTINO WHICH WAS BETWEENTHE ROADS ALONG WHICH THOSE SUPPLIES LAY JUST AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TOSAY WHEN IT WAS DECIDED TO ABANDON MOSCOW SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAYPRECISELY WHEN OR BY WHOM IT WAS DECIDED TO MOVE TO TARUTINO ONLYWHEN THE ARMY HAD GOT THERE AS THE RESULT OF INNUMERABLE AND VARYINGFORCES DID PEOPLE BEGIN TO

OF FORCESIF IN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN BY HISTORIANS ESPECIALLY FRENCH ONES WEFIND THEIR WARS AND BATTLES CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUSLYFORMED PLANS THE ONLY CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN IS THAT THOSE DESCRIPTIONSARE FALSETHE BATTLE OF TARUTINO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT ATTAIN THE AIM TOLL HAD INVIEWTO LEAD THE TROOPS INTO ACTION IN THE ORDER PRESCRIBED BY THEDISPOSITIONS NOR THAT WHICH COUNT ORLOVDENISOV MAY HAVE HAD IN VIEWTO TAKE MURAT PRISONER NOR THE RESULT OF IMMEDIATELY DESTROYING THEWHOLE CORPS WHICH BENNIGSEN AND OTHERS MAY HAVE HAD IN VIEW NOR THEAIM OF THE OFFICER WHO WISHED TO

FRENCH DOES NOT MAKE A SINGLE ATTEMPT TO ATTACK FORA WHOLE MONTH NAPOLEONS POSITION IS MOST BRILLIANT HE CAN EITHER FALLON THE RUSSIAN ARMY WITH DOUBLE ITS STRENGTH AND DESTROY IT NEGOTIATEAN ADVANTAGEOUS PEACE OR IN CASE OF A REFUSAL MAKE A MENACING MOVE ONPETERSBURG OR EVEN IN THE CASE OF A REVERSE RETURN TO SMOLENSK ORVILNA OR REMAIN IN MOSCOW IN SHORT NO SPECIAL GENIUS WOULD SEEM TO BEREQUIRED TO RETAIN THE BRILLIANT POSITION THE FRENCH HELD AT THAT TIMEFOR THAT ONLY VERY SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS WERE NECESSARY NOT TO ALLOWTHE TROOPS TO LOOT TO PREPARE WINTER CLOTHINGOF WHICH THERE WASSUFFICIENT IN MOSCOW FOR THE WHOLE ARMYAND METHODICALLY TO COLLECT THEPROVISIONS OF WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FRENCH HISTORIANS THERE WEREENOUGH IN MOSCOW TO SUPPLY THE WHOLE ARMY FOR SIX MONTHS YET NAPOLEONTHAT GREATEST OF ALL GENIUSES WHO THE HISTORIANS DECLARE HAD CONTROL OFTHE ARMY TOOK NONE OF THESE STEPSHE NOT MERELY DID NOTHING OF THE KIND BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE USED HISPOWER TO SELECT THE MOST FOOLISH AND RUINOUS OF ALL THE COURSES OPEN TOHIM OF ALL THAT NAPOLEON MIGHT HAVE DONE WINTERING IN MOSCOWADVANCING ON PETERSBURG OR ON NIZHNINOVGOROD OR RETIRING BY A MORENORTHERLY OR MORE SOUTHERLY ROUTE SAY BY THE ROAD KUTUZOV AFTERWARDSTOOK NOTHING MORE STUPID OR DISASTROUS CAN BE IMAGINED THAN WHAT HEACTUALLY DID HE REMAINED IN MOSCOW TILL OCTOBER LETTING THE TROOPSPLUNDER THE CITY THEN HESITATING WHETHER TO LEAVE A GARRISON BEHINDHIM HE QUITTED MOSCOW APPROACHED KUTUZOV WITHOUT JOINING BATTLETURNED TO THE RIGHT AND REACHED MALOYAROSLAVETS AGAIN WITHOUTATTEMPTING TO BREAK THROUGH AND TAKE THE ROAD KUTUZOV TOOK BUT RETIRINGINSTEAD TO MOZHAYSK ALONG THE DEVASTATED SMOLENSK ROAD NOTHING MORESTUPID THAN THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DEVISED OR MORE DISASTROUS FOR THEARMY AS THE SEQUEL SHOWED HAD NAPOLEONS AIM BEEN TO DESTROY HIS ARMYTHE MOST SKILLFUL STRATEGIST COULD HARDLY HAVE DEVISED ANY SERIES OFACTIONS THAT WOULD SO COMPLETELY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT PURPOSEINDEPENDENTLY OF ANYTHING THE RUSSIAN ARMY MIGHT DONAPOLEON THE MAN OF GENIUS DID THIS BUT TO SAY THAT HE DESTROYED HISARMY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO OR BECAUSE HE WAS VERY STUPID WOULD BE ASUNJUST AS TO SAY THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TROOPS TO MOSCOW BECAUSE HEWISHED TO AND BECAUSE HE WAS VERY CLEVER AND A GENIUSIN BOTH CASES HIS PERSONAL ACTIVITY HAVING NO MORE FORCE THAN THEPERSONAL ACTIVITY OF ANY SOLDIER MERELY COINCIDED WITH THE LAWS THATGUIDED THE EVENTTHE HISTORIANS QUITE FALSELY REPRESENT NAPOLEONS FACULTIES AS HAVINGWEAKENED IN MOSCOW AND DO SO ONLY BECAUSE THE RESULTS DID NOT JUSTIFYHIS ACTIONS HE EMPLOYED ALL HIS ABILITY AND STRENGTH TO DO THE BEST HECOULD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ARMY AS HE HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY AND AS HE DIDSUBSEQUENTLY IN  HIS ACTIVITY AT THAT TIME WAS NO LESS ASTOUNDINGTHAN IT WAS IN EGYPT IN ITALY IN AUSTRIA AND IN PRUSSIA WE DO NOTKNOW FOR CERTAIN IN HOW FAR HIS GENIUS WAS GENUINE IN EGYPTWHERE FORTYCENTURIES LOOKED DOWN UPON HIS GRANDEURFOR HIS GREAT EXPLOITS THEREARE ALL TOLD US BY FRENCHMEN WE CANNOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE HIS GENIUSIN AUSTRIA OR PRUSSIA FOR WE HAVE TO DRAW OUR INFORMATION FROM FRENCHOR GERMAN SOURCES AND THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE SURRENDER OF WHOLE CORPSWITHOUT FIGHTING AND OF FORTRESSES WITHOUT A SIEGE MUST INCLINE GERMANSTO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUS AS THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THE WAR CARRIED ON INGERMANY BUT WE THANK GOD HAVE NO NEED TO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUS INORDER TO HIDE OUR SHAME WE HAVE PAID FOR THE RIGHT TO LOOK AT THEMATTER PLAINLY AND SIMPLY AND WE WILL NOT ABANDON THAT RIGHTHIS ACTIVITY IN MOSCOW WAS AS AMAZING AND AS FULL OF GENIUS

THE ONE FORMERLYBROUGHT BY LAURISTON SAYING THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF PEACESOON AFTER THAT A REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM DOROKHOVS GUERRILLADETACHMENT OPERATING TO THE LEFT OF TARUTINO THAT TROOPS OF BROUSSIERSDIVISION HAD BEEN SEEN AT FORMINSK AND THAT BEING SEPARATED FROM THEREST OF THE FRENCH ARMY THEY MIGHT EASILY BE DESTROYED THE SOLDIERS ANDOFFICERS AGAIN DEMANDED ACTION GENERALS ON THE STAFF EXCITED BY THEMEMORY OF THE EASY VICTORY AT TARUTINO URGED KUTUZOV TO CARRY OUTDOROKHOVS SUGGESTION KUTUZOV DID NOT CONSIDER ANY OFFENSIVE NECESSARYTHE RESULT WAS A COMPROMISE WHICH WAS INEVITABLE A SMALL DETACHMENT WASSENT TO FORMINSK TO ATTACK BROUSSIERBY A STRANGE COINCIDENCE THIS TASK WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A MOSTDIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT ONE WAS ENTRUSTED TO DOKHTUROVTHAT SAMEMODEST LITTLE DOKHTUROV WHOM NO ONE HAD DESCRIBED TO US AS DRAWING UPPLANS OF BATTLES DASHING ABOUT IN FRONT OF REGIMENTS SHOWERING CROSSESON BATTERIES AND SO ON AND WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE AND WAS SPOKEN OF ASUNDECIDED AND UNDISCERNINGBUT WHOM WE FIND COMMANDING WHEREVER THEPOSITION WAS MOST DIFFICULT ALL THROUGH THE RUSSOFRENCH WARS FROMAUSTERLITZ TO THE YEAR  AT AUSTERLITZ HE REMAINED LAST AT THEAUGEZD DAM RALLYING THE REGIMENTS SAVING WHAT WAS POSSIBLE WHEN ALLWERE FLYING AND PERISHING AND NOT A SINGLE GENERAL WAS LEFT IN THE REARGUARD ILL WITH FEVER HE WENT TO SMOLENSK WITH TWENTY THOUSAND MEN TODEFEND THE TOWN AGAINST NAPOLEONS WHOLE ARMY IN SMOLENSK AT THEMALAKHOV GATE HE HAD HARDLY DOZED OFF IN A PAROXYSM OF FEVER BEFORE HEWAS AWAKENED BY THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE TOWNAND

THITHER AND BORODINO BECAME THEGREATEST GLORY OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY MANY HEROES HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED TOUS IN VERSE AND PROSE BUT OF DOKHTUROV SCARCELY A WORD HAS BEEN SAIDIT WAS DOKHTUROV AGAIN WHOM THEY SENT TO FORMINSK AND FROM THERE TOMALOYAROSLAVETS THE PLACE WHERE THE LAST BATTLE WITH THE FRENCH WASFOUGHT AND WHERE THE OBVIOUS DISINTEGRATION OF THE FRENCH ARMY BEGANAND WE ARE TOLD OF MANY GENIUSES AND HEROES OF THAT PERIOD OF THECAMPAIGN BUT OF DOKHTUROV NOTHING OR VERY LITTLE IS SAID AND THATDUBIOUSLY AND THIS SILENCE ABOUT DOKHTUROV IS THE CLEAREST TESTIMONY TOHIS MERITIT IS NATURAL FOR A MAN WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORKINGS OF AMACHINE TO IMAGINE THAT A SHAVING THAT HAS FALLEN INTO IT BY CHANCE ANDIS INTERFERING WITH ITS ACTION AND TOSSING ABOUT IN IT IS ITS MOSTIMPORTANT PART THE MAN WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEMACHINE CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT THE SMALL CONNECTING COGWHEEL WHICHREVOLVES QUIETLY IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE MACHINE ANDNOT

CORRESPONDED WITH THE EMPEROR AND HAD MOREINFLUENCE THAN ANYONE ELSE ON THE STAFF HAD BEGUN TO AVOID HIM KUTUZOVWAS MORE AT EASE AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HIMSELF AND HIS TROOPS BEINGOBLIGED TO TAKE PART IN USELESS AGGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS THE LESSON OF THETARUTINO BATTLE AND OF THE DAY BEFORE IT WHICH KUTUZOV REMEMBERED WITHPAIN MUST HE THOUGHT HAVE SOME EFFECT ON OTHERS TOOTHEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN ONLY LOSE BY TAKING THE OFFENSIVEPATIENCE AND TIME ARE MY WARRIORS MY CHAMPIONS THOUGHT KUTUZOV HEKNEW THAT AN APPLE SHOULD NOT BE PLUCKED WHILE IT IS GREEN IT WILL FALLOF ITSELF WHEN RIPE BUT IF PICKED UNRIPE THE APPLE IS SPOILED THE TREEIS HARMED AND YOUR TEETH ARE SET ON EDGE LIKE AN EXPERIENCED SPORTSMANHE KNEW THAT THE BEAST WAS WOUNDED AND WOUNDED AS ONLY THE WHOLESTRENGTH OF RUSSIA COULD HAVE WOUNDED IT BUT WHETHER IT WAS MORTALLYWOUNDED OR NOT WAS STILL AN UNDECIDED QUESTION NOW BY THE FACT OFLAURISTON AND BARTHELEMI HAVING BEEN SENT AND BY THE REPORTS OF THEGUERRILLAS KUTUZOV WAS ALMOST SURE THAT THE WOUND WAS MORTAL BUT HENEEDED FURTHER PROOFS AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO WAITTHEY WANT TO RUN TO SEE HOW THEY HAVE WOUNDED IT WAIT AND WE SHALLSEE CONTINUAL MANEUVERS CONTINUAL ADVANCES THOUGHT HE WHAT FORONLY TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES AS IF FIGHTING WERE FUN THEY ARE LIKECHILDREN FROM WHOM ONE CANT GET ANY SENSIBLE ACCOUNT OF WHAT HASHAPPENED BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT TO SHOW HOW WELL THEY CAN FIGHT BUTTHATS NOT WHAT IS NEEDED NOWAND WHAT INGENIOUS MANEUVERS THEY ALL PROPOSE TO ME IT SEEMS TO THEMTHAT WHEN THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF TWO OR THREE CONTINGENCIES HEREMEMBERED THE GENERAL PLAN SENT HIM FROM PETERSBURG THEY HAVEFORESEEN EVERYTHING BUT THE CONTINGENCIES ARE ENDLESSTHE UNDECIDED QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE WOUND INFLICTED AT BORODINO WASMORTAL OR NOT HAD HUNG OVER KUTUZOVS HEAD FOR A WHOLE MONTH ON THE ONEHAND THE FRENCH HAD OCCUPIED MOSCOW ON THE OTHER KUTUZOV FELT ASSUREDWITH ALL HIS BEING THAT THE TERRIBLE BLOW INTO WHICH HE AND ALL THERUSSIANS HAD PUT THEIR WHOLE STRENGTH MUST HAVE BEEN MORTAL BUT IN ANYCASE PROOFS WERE NEEDED HE HAD WAITED A WHOLE MONTH FOR THEM AND GREWMORE IMPATIENT THE LONGER HE WAITED LYING ON HIS BED DURING THOSESLEEPLESS NIGHTS HE DID JUST WHAT HE REPROACHED THOSE YOUNGER GENERALSFOR DOING HE IMAGINED ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES JUST LIKETHE YOUNGER MEN BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HE SAW THOUSANDS OFCONTINGENCIES INSTEAD OF TWO OR THREE AND BASED NOTHING ON THEM THELONGER HE THOUGHT THE MORE CONTINGENCIES PRESENTED THEMSELVES HEIMAGINED ALL SORTS OF MOVEMENTS OF THE NAPOLEONIC ARMY AS A WHOLE OR INSECTIONSAGAINST PETERSBURG OR AGAINST HIM OR TO OUTFLANK HIM HETHOUGHT TOO OF THE POSSIBILITY WHICH HE FEARED MOST OF ALL THATNAPOLEON MIGHT FIGHT HIM WITH HIS OWN WEAPON AND REMAIN IN MOSCOWAWAITING HIM KUTUZOV EVEN IMAGINED THAT NAPOLEONS ARMY MIGHT TURN BACKTHROUGH MEDYN AND YUKHNOV BUT THE ONE THING HE COULD NOT FORESEE WASWHAT HAPPENEDTHE INSANE CONVULSIVE STAMPEDE OF NAPOLEONS ARMY DURINGITS FIRST ELEVEN DAYS AFTER LEAVING MOSCOW A STAMPEDE WHICH MADEPOSSIBLE WHAT KUTUZOV HAD NOT YET EVEN DARED TO THINK OFTHE COMPLETEEXTERMINATION OF THE FRENCH DOROKHOVS REPORT ABOUT BROUSSIERSDIVISION THE GUERRILLAS REPORTS OF DISTRESS IN NAPOLEONS ARMY RUMORSOF PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING MOSCOW ALL CONFIRMED THE SUPPOSITION THATTHE FRENCH ARMY WAS BEATEN AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT BUT THESE WERE ONLYSUPPOSITIONS WHICH SEEMED IMPORTANT TO THE YOUNGER MEN BUT NOT TOKUTUZOV WITH HIS SIXTY YEARS EXPERIENCE HE KNEW WHAT VALUE TO ATTACHTO RUMORS KNEW HOW APT PEOPLE WHO DESIRE ANYTHING ARE TO GROUP ALL NEWSSO THAT IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM WHAT THEY DESIRE AND HE KNEW HOW READILYIN SUCH CASES THEY OMIT ALL THAT MAKES FOR THE CONTRARY AND THE MORE HEDESIRED IT THE LESS HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BELIEVE IT THIS QUESTIONABSORBED ALL HIS MENTAL POWERS ALL ELSE WAS TO HIM ONLY LIFESCUSTOMARY ROUTINE TO SUCH CUSTOMARY ROUTINE BELONGED HIS CONVERSATIONSWITH THE STAFF THE LETTERS HE WROTE FROM TARUTINO TO MADAME DE STAELTHE READING OF NOVELS THE DISTRIBUTION OF AWARDS HIS CORRESPONDENCEWITH PETERSBURG AND SO ON BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCH WHICH HEALONE FORESAW WAS HIS HEARTS ONE DESIREON THE NIGHT OF THE ELEVENTH OF OCTOBER HE LAY LEANING ON HIS ARM ANDTHINKING OF THATTHERE WAS A STIR IN THE NEXT ROOM AND HE HEARD THE STEPS OF TOLLKONOVNITSYN AND BOLKHOVITINOVEH WHOS THERE COME IN COME IN WHAT NEWS THE FIELD MARSHAL CALLEDOUT TO THEMWHILE A FOOTMAN WAS LIGHTING A CANDLE TOLL COMMUNICATED THE SUBSTANCEOF THE NEWSWHO BROUGHT IT ASKED KUTUZOV WITH A LOOK WHICH WHEN THE CANDLE WASLIT STRUCK TOLL BY ITS COLD SEVERITYTHERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT YOUR HIGHNESSCALL HIM IN CALL HIM HEREKUTUZOV SAT UP WITH ONE LEG HANGING DOWN FROM THE BED AND HIS BIG PAUNCHRESTING AGAINST THE OTHER WHICH WAS DOUBLED UNDER HIM HE SCREWED UP HISSEEING EYE TO SCRUTINIZE THE MESSENGER MORE CAREFULLY AS IF WISHING TOREAD IN HIS FACE WHAT PREOCCUPIED HIS OWN MINDTELL ME

EVERYTHING AND WAS THEN SILENT AWAITINGINSTRUCTIONS TOLL WAS BEGINNING TO SAY SOMETHING BUT KUTUZOV CHECKEDHIM HE TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING BUT HIS FACE SUDDENLY PUCKERED ANDWRINKLED HE WAVED HIS ARM AT TOLL AND TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OFTHE ROOM TO THE CORNER DARKENED BY THE ICONS THAT HUNG THEREO LORD MY CREATOR THOU HAS HEARD OUR PRAYER SAID HE IN ATREMULOUS VOICE WITH FOLDED HANDS RUSSIA IS SAVED I THANK THEE OLORD AND HE WEPTCHAPTER XVIIIFROM THE TIME HE RECEIVED THIS NEWS TO THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN ALLKUTUZOVS ACTIVITY WAS DIRECTED TOWARD RESTRAINING HIS TROOPS BYAUTHORITY BY GUILE AND BY ENTREATY FROM USELESS ATTACKS MANEUVERSOR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE PERISHING ENEMY DOKHTUROV WENT TO MALOYAROSLAVETS BUT KUTUZOV LINGERED WITH THE MAIN ARMY AND GAVE ORDERS FORTHE EVACUATION OF KALUGAA RETREAT BEYOND WHICH TOWN SEEMED TO HIMQUITE POSSIBLEEVERYWHERE KUTUZOV RETREATED BUT THE ENEMY WITHOUT WAITING FOR HISRETREAT FLED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONNAPOLEONS HISTORIANS DESCRIBE TO US HIS SKILLED MANEUVERS AT TARUTINOAND MALOYAROSLAVETS AND MAKE CONJECTURES AS TO WHAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED HAD NAPOLEON BEEN IN TIME TO PENETRATE INTO THE RICH SOUTHERNPROVINCESBUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE FACT THAT NOTHING PREVENTED HIM FROM ADVANCINGINTO THOSE SOUTHERN PROVINCES FOR THE RUSSIAN ARMY DID NOT BAR HISWAY THE HISTORIANS FORGET THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE SAVED HIS ARMY FORTHEN ALREADY IT BORE WITHIN ITSELF THE GERMS OF INEVITABLE RUIN HOWCOULD THAT ARMYWHICH HAD FOUND ABUNDANT SUPPLIES IN MOSCOW AND HADTRAMPLED THEM UNDERFOOT INSTEAD OF KEEPING THEM AND ON ARRIVING ATSMOLENSK HAD LOOTED PROVISIONS INSTEAD OF STORING THEMHOW COULD THATARMY RECUPERATE IN KALUGA PROVINCE WHICH WAS INHABITED BY RUSSIANS SUCHAS THOSE WHO LIVED IN MOSCOW AND WHERE FIRE HAD THE SAME PROPERTY OFCONSUMING WHAT WAS SET ABLAZETHAT ARMY COULD NOT RECOVER ANYWHERE SINCE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO ANDTHE PILLAGE OF MOSCOW IT HAD BORNE WITHIN ITSELF AS IT WERE THECHEMICAL ELEMENTS OF DISSOLUTIONTHE MEMBERS OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN AN ARMYNAPOLEON HIMSELF AND ALL HISSOLDIERS FLEDWITHOUT KNOWING WHITHER EACH CONCERNED ONLY TO MAKE HISESCAPE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FROM THIS POSITION OF THE HOPELESSNESS OFWHICH THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS VAGUELY CONSCIOUSSO IT CAME ABOUT THAT AT THE COUNCIL AT MALOYAROSLAVETS WHEN THEGENERALS PRETENDING TO CONFER TOGETHER EXPRESSED VARIOUS OPINIONS ALLMOUTHS WERE CLOSED BY THE OPINION UTTERED BY THE SIMPLEMINDED SOLDIERMOUTON WHO SPEAKING LAST SAID WHAT THEY ALL FELT THAT THE ONE THINGNEEDFUL WAS TO GET AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND NO ONE NOT EVENNAPOLEON COULD SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THAT TRUTH WHICH THEY ALLRECOGNIZEDBUT THOUGH THEY ALL REALIZED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO GET AWAY THERESTILL REMAINED A FEELING OF SHAME AT ADMITTING THAT THEY MUST FLEE ANEXTERNAL SHOCK WAS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THAT SHAME AND THIS SHOCK CAME INDUE TIME IT WAS WHAT THE FRENCH CALLED LE HOURRA DE LEMPEREURTHE DAY AFTER THE COUNCIL AT MALOYAROSLAVETS NAPOLEON RODE OUT EARLY INTHE MORNING AMID THE LINES OF HIS ARMY WITH HIS SUITE OF MARSHALS AND ANESCORT ON THE PRETEXT OF INSPECTING THE ARMY AND THE SCENE OF THEPREVIOUS AND OF THE IMPENDING BATTLE SOME COSSACKS ON THE PROWL FORBOOTY FELL IN WITH THE EMPEROR AND VERY NEARLY CAPTURED HIM IF THECOSSACKS DID NOT CAPTURE NAPOLEON THEN WHAT SAVED HIM WAS THE VERYTHING THAT WAS DESTROYING THE FRENCH ARMY THE BOOTY ON WHICH THECOSSACKS FELL HERE AS AT TARUTINO THEY WENT AFTER PLUNDER LEAVING THEMEN DISREGARDING NAPOLEON THEY RUSHED AFTER THE PLUNDER AND NAPOLEONMANAGED TO ESCAPEWHEN LES ENFANTS DU DON MIGHT SO EASILY HAVE TAKEN THE EMPEROR HIMSELFIN THE MIDST OF HIS ARMY IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUTTO FLY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE ALONG THE NEAREST FAMILIAR ROAD NAPOLEONWITH HIS FORTYYEAROLD STOMACH UNDERSTOOD THAT HINT NOT FEELING HISFORMER AGILITY AND BOLDNESS AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE FRIGHT THECOSSACKS HAD GIVEN HIM HE AT ONCE AGREED WITH MOUTON AND ISSUED ORDERSAS THE HISTORIANS TELL USTO RETREAT BY THE SMOLENSK ROADTHAT NAPOLEON AGREED WITH MOUTON AND THAT THE ARMY RETREATED DOES NOTPROVE THAT NAPOLEON CAUSED IT TO RETREAT BUT THAT THE FORCES WHICHINFLUENCED THE WHOLE ARMY AND DIRECTED IT ALONG THE MOZHAYSK THAT ISTHE SMOLENSK ROAD ACTED SIMULTANEOUSLY ON HIM ALSOCHAPTER XIXA MAN IN MOTION ALWAYS DEVISES AN AIM FOR THAT MOTION TO BE ABLE TO GOA THOUSAND MILES HE MUST IMAGINE THAT SOMETHING GOOD AWAITS HIM AT THEEND OF THOSE THOUSAND MILES ONE MUST HAVE THE PROSPECT OF A PROMISEDLAND TO HAVE THE STRENGTH TO MOVETHE PROMISED LAND FOR THE FRENCH DURING THEIR ADVANCE HAD BEEN MOSCOWDURING THEIR RETREAT IT WAS THEIR NATIVE LAND BUT THAT NATIVE LAND WASTOO FAR OFF AND FOR A MAN GOING A THOUSAND MILES IT IS ABSOLUTELYNECESSARY TO SET ASIDE HIS FINAL GOAL AND TO SAY TO HIMSELF TODAY ISHALL GET TO A PLACE TWENTYFIVE MILES OFF WHERE I SHALL REST AND SPENDTHE NIGHT AND DURING THE FIRST DAYS JOURNEY THAT RESTING PLACEECLIPSES HIS ULTIMATE GOAL AND ATTRACTS ALL HIS

IMMEDIATE GOAL WASSMOLENSK TOWARD WHICH ALL THEIR DESIRES AND HOPES ENORMOUSLYINTENSIFIED IN THE MASS URGED THEM ON IT WAS NOT THAT THEY KNEW THATMUCH FOOD AND FRESH TROOPS AWAITED THEM IN SMOLENSK NOR THAT THEY WERETOLD SO ON THE CONTRARY THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS AND NAPOLEON HIMSELFKNEW THAT PROVISIONS WERE SCARCE THERE BUT BECAUSE THIS ALONE COULDGIVE THEM STRENGTH TO MOVE ON AND ENDURE THEIR PRESENT PRIVATIONS SOBOTH THOSE WHO KNEW AND THOSE WHO DID NOT KNOW DECEIVED THEMSELVES ANDPUSHED ON TO SMOLENSK AS TO A PROMISED LANDCOMING OUT ONTO THE HIGHROAD THE FRENCH FLED WITH SURPRISING

DREW EACH OF THEM INTHE SAME DIRECTION ON THE OTHER HAND AN ARMY CORPS COULD NOT SURRENDERTO A COMPANY AND THOUGH THE FRENCH AVAILED THEMSELVES OF EVERYCONVENIENT OPPORTUNITY TO DETACH THEMSELVES AND TO SURRENDER ON THESLIGHTEST DECENT PRETEXT SUCH PRETEXTS DID NOT ALWAYS OCCUR THEIR VERYNUMBERS AND THEIR CROWDED AND SWIFT MOVEMENT DEPRIVED THEM OF THATPOSSIBILITY AND RENDERED IT NOT ONLY

OUR OWN MEN AND INHUMANLY SLAUGHTERING UNFORTUNATE WRETCHES WHATIS THE USE OF THAT WHEN A THIRD OF THEIR ARMY HAS MELTED AWAY ON THEROAD FROM MOSCOW TO VYAZMA WITHOUT ANY BATTLE BUT DRAWING FROM

FATAL PATH TO SMOLENSKBOOK FOURTEEN CHAPTER ITHE BATTLE OF BORODINO WITH THE OCCUPATION OF MOSCOW THAT FOLLOWED ITAND THE FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH WITHOUT FURTHER CONFLICTS IS ONE OF THEMOST INSTRUCTIVE PHENOMENA IN HISTORYALL HISTORIANS AGREE THAT THE EXTERNAL ACTIVITY OF STATES AND NATIONS INTHEIR CONFLICTS WITH ONE ANOTHER IS EXPRESSED IN WARS AND THAT AS ADIRECT RESULT OF GREATER OR LESS SUCCESS IN WAR THE POLITICAL STRENGTHOF STATES AND NATIONS INCREASES OR DECREASESSTRANGE AS MAY BE THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF HOW SOME KING OR EMPERORHAVING QUARRELED WITH ANOTHER COLLECTS AN ARMY FIGHTS HIS ENEMYSARMY GAINS A VICTORY BY KILLING THREE FIVE OR TEN THOUSAND MEN ANDSUBJUGATES A KINGDOM AND AN ENTIRE NATION OF SEVERAL MILLIONS ALL THEFACTS OF HISTORY AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT CONFIRM THE TRUTH OF THESTATEMENT THAT THE GREATER OR LESSER SUCCESS OF ONE ARMY AGAINST ANOTHERIS THE CAUSE OR AT LEAST AN ESSENTIAL INDICATION OF AN INCREASE ORDECREASE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE NATIONEVEN THOUGH IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLEWHY THE DEFEAT OF AN ARMYA HUNDREDTH PART OF A NATIONSHOULD OBLIGETHAT WHOLE NATION TO SUBMIT AN ARMY GAINS A VICTORY AND AT ONCE THERIGHTS OF THE CONQUERING NATION HAVE INCREASED TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEDEFEATED AN ARMY HAS SUFFERED DEFEAT AND AT ONCE A PEOPLE LOSES ITSRIGHTS IN PROPORTION TO THE SEVERITY OF THE REVERSE AND IF ITS ARMYSUFFERS A COMPLETE DEFEAT THE NATION IS QUITE SUBJUGATEDSO ACCORDING TO HISTORY IT HAS BEEN FOUND FROM THE MOST ANCIENT TIMESAND SO IT IS TO OUR OWN DAY ALL NAPOLEONS WARS SERVE TO CONFIRM THISRULE IN PROPORTION TO THE DEFEAT OF THE AUSTRIAN ARMY AUSTRIA LOSES ITSRIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS AND THE STRENGTH OF FRANCE INCREASE THEVICTORIES OF THE FRENCH AT JENA AND AUERSTADT DESTROY THE INDEPENDENTEXISTENCE OF PRUSSIABUT THEN IN  THE FRENCH GAIN A VICTORY NEAR MOSCOW MOSCOW ISTAKEN AND AFTER THAT WITH NO FURTHER BATTLES IT IS NOT RUSSIA THATCEASES TO EXIST BUT THE FRENCH ARMY OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THENNAPOLEONIC FRANCE ITSELF TO STRAIN THE FACTS TO FIT THE RULES OFHISTORY TO SAY THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE AT BORODINO REMAINED IN THEHANDS OF THE RUSSIANS OR THAT AFTER MOSCOW THERE WERE OTHER BATTLESTHAT DESTROYED NAPOLEONS ARMY IS IMPOSSIBLEAFTER THE FRENCH VICTORY AT BORODINO THERE WAS NO GENERAL ENGAGEMENT NORANY THAT WERE AT ALL SERIOUS YET THE FRENCH ARMY CEASED TO EXIST WHATDOES THIS MEAN IF IT WERE AN EXAMPLE TAKEN FROM THE HISTORY OF CHINAWE MIGHT SAY THAT IT WAS NOT AN HISTORIC PHENOMENON WHICH IS THEHISTORIANS USUAL EXPEDIENT WHEN ANYTHING DOES NOT FIT THEIR STANDARDSIF THE MATTER CONCERNED SOME BRIEF CONFLICT IN WHICH ONLY A SMALL NUMBEROF TROOPS TOOK PART WE MIGHT TREAT IT AS AN EXCEPTION BUT THIS EVENTOCCURRED BEFORE OUR FATHERS EYES AND FOR THEM IT WAS A QUESTION OF THELIFE OR DEATH OF THEIR FATHERLAND AND IT HAPPENED IN THE GREATEST OFALL KNOWN WARSTHE PERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGN OF  FROM THE BATTLE OF BORODINO TO THEEXPULSION OF THE FRENCH PROVED THAT THE WINNING OF A BATTLE DOES NOTPRODUCE A CONQUEST AND IS NOT EVEN AN INVARIABLE INDICATION OF CONQUESTIT PROVED THAT THE FORCE WHICH DECIDES THE FATE OF PEOPLES LIES NOT INTHE CONQUERORS NOR EVEN IN ARMIES AND BATTLES BUT IN SOMETHING ELSETHE FRENCH HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE FRENCH ARMYBEFORE IT LEFT MOSCOW AFFIRM THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER IN THE GRAND ARMYEXCEPT THE CAVALRY THE ARTILLERY AND THE TRANSPORTTHERE WAS NOFORAGE FOR THE HORSES OR THE CATTLE THAT WAS A MISFORTUNE NO ONE COULDREMEDY FOR THE PEASANTS OF THE DISTRICT BURNED THEIR HAY RATHER THANLET THE FRENCH HAVE ITTHE VICTORY GAINED DID NOT BRING THE USUAL RESULTS BECAUSE THE PEASANTSKARP AND VLAS WHO AFTER THE FRENCH HAD EVACUATED MOSCOW DROVE IN THEIRCARTS TO PILLAGE THE TOWN AND IN GENERAL PERSONALLY FAILED TO MANIFESTANY HEROIC FEELINGS AND THE WHOLE INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE OF SUCHPEASANTS DID NOT BRING THEIR HAY TO MOSCOW FOR THE HIGH PRICE OFFEREDTHEM BUT BURNED IT INSTEADLET US IMAGINE TWO MEN WHO HAVE COME OUT TO FIGHT A DUEL WITH RAPIERSACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF THE ART OF FENCING THE FENCING HAS GONEON FOR SOME TIME SUDDENLY ONE OF THE COMBATANTS FEELING HIMSELFWOUNDED AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MATTER IS NO JOKE BUT CONCERNS HISLIFE THROWS DOWN HIS RAPIER AND SEIZING THE FIRST CUDGEL THAT COMES TOHAND BEGINS TO BRANDISH IT THEN LET US IMAGINE THAT THE COMBATANT WHOSO SENSIBLY EMPLOYED THE BEST AND SIMPLEST MEANS TO ATTAIN HIS END WASAT THE SAME TIME INFLUENCED BY TRADITIONS OF CHIVALRY AND DESIRING TOCONCEAL THE FACTS OF THE CASE INSISTED THAT HE HAD GAINED HIS VICTORYWITH THE RAPIER ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF ART ONE CAN IMAGINE WHATCONFUSION AND OBSCURITY WOULD RESULT FROM SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF THE DUELTHE FENCER WHO DEMANDED A CONTEST ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FENCING WASTHE FRENCH ARMY HIS OPPONENT WHO THREW AWAY THE RAPIER AND SNATCHED UPTHE CUDGEL WAS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THOSE WHO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE MATTERACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FENCING ARE THE HISTORIANS WHO HAVE DESCRIBEDTHE EVENTAFTER THE BURNING OF SMOLENSK A WAR BEGAN WHICH DID NOT FOLLOW ANYPREVIOUS TRADITIONS OF WAR THE BURNING OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES THERETREATS AFTER BATTLES THE BLOW DEALT AT BORODINO AND THE RENEWEDRETREAT THE BURNING OF MOSCOW THE CAPTURE OF MARAUDERS THE SEIZURE OFTRANSPORTS AND THE GUERRILLA WAR WERE ALL DEPARTURES FROM THE RULESNAPOLEON FELT THIS AND FROM THE TIME HE TOOK UP THE CORRECT FENCINGATTITUDE IN MOSCOW AND INSTEAD OF HIS OPPONENTS RAPIER SAW A CUDGELRAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD HE DID NOT CEASE TO COMPLAIN TO KUTUZOV AND TOTHE EMPEROR ALEXANDER THAT THE WAR WAS BEING CARRIED ON CONTRARY TO ALLTHE RULESAS IF THERE WERE ANY RULES FOR KILLING PEOPLE IN SPITE OFTHE COMPLAINTS OF THE FRENCH AS TO THE NONOBSERVANCE OF THE RULES INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT TO SOME HIGHLY PLACED RUSSIANS IT SEEMED RATHERDISGRACEFUL TO FIGHT WITH A CUDGEL AND THEY WANTED TO ASSUME A POSE ENQUARTE OR EN TIERCE ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES AND TO MAKE AN ADROITTHRUST EN PRIME AND SO ONTHE CUDGEL OF THE PEOPLES WAR WAS LIFTEDWITH ALL ITS MENACING AND MAJESTIC STRENGTH AND WITHOUT CONSULTINGANYONES TASTES OR RULES AND REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING ELSE IT ROSE ANDFELL WITH STUPID SIMPLICITY BUT CONSISTENTLY AND BELABORED THE FRENCHTILL THE WHOLE INVASION HAD PERISHEDAND IT IS WELL FOR A PEOPLE WHO DO NOTAS THE FRENCH DID IN SALUTE ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF ART AND PRESENTING THE HILT OFTHEIR RAPIER GRACEFULLY AND POLITELY HAND IT TO THEIR MAGNANIMOUSCONQUEROR BUT AT THE MOMENT OF TRIAL WITHOUT ASKING WHAT RULES OTHERSHAVE ADOPTED IN SIMILAR CASES SIMPLY AND EASILY PICK UP THE FIRSTCUDGEL THAT COMES TO HAND AND STRIKE WITH IT TILL THE FEELING OFRESENTMENT AND REVENGE IN THEIR SOUL YIELDS TO A FEELING OF CONTEMPT ANDCOMPASSIONCHAPTER IIONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS AND ADVANTAGEOUS DEPARTURES FROM THE SOCALLEDLAWS OF WAR IS THE ACTION OF SCATTERED GROUPS AGAINST MEN PRESSEDTOGETHER IN A MASS SUCH ACTION ALWAYS OCCURS IN WARS THAT TAKE ON ANATIONAL CHARACTER IN SUCH ACTIONS INSTEAD OF TWO CROWDS OPPOSING EACHOTHER THE MEN DISPERSE ATTACK SINGLY RUN AWAY WHEN ATTACKED BYSTRONGER FORCES BUT AGAIN ATTACK WHEN OPPORTUNITY OFFERS THIS WAS DONEBY THE GUERRILLAS IN SPAIN BY THE MOUNTAIN TRIBES IN THE CAUCASUS ANDBY THE RUSSIANS IN PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THIS KIND OF WAR GUERRILLA WARFARE AND ASSUME THATBY SO CALLING IT THEY HAVE EXPLAINED ITS MEANING BUT SUCH A WAR DOESNOT FIT IN UNDER ANY RULE AND IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO A WELLKNOWN RULEOF TACTICS WHICH IS ACCEPTED AS INFALLIBLE THAT RULE SAYS THAT ANATTACKER SHOULD CONCENTRATE HIS FORCES IN ORDER TO BE STRONGER THAN HISOPPONENT AT THE MOMENT OF CONFLICTGUERRILLA WAR ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AS HISTORY SHOWS DIRECTLY INFRINGESTHAT RULETHIS CONTRADICTION ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT MILITARY SCIENCE ASSUMESTHE STRENGTH OF AN ARMY TO BE IDENTICAL WITH ITS NUMBERS MILITARYSCIENCE SAYS THAT THE MORE TROOPS THE GREATER THE STRENGTH LES GROSBATAILLONS ONT TOUJOURS RAISON  LARGE BATTALIONS ARE ALWAYS VICTORIOUSFOR MILITARY SCIENCE TO SAY THIS IS LIKE DEFINING MOMENTUM IN MECHANICSBY REFERENCE TO THE MASS ONLY STATING THAT MOMENTA ARE EQUAL OR UNEQUALTO EACH OTHER SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MASSES INVOLVED ARE EQUAL OR UNEQUALMOMENTUM QUANTITY OF MOTION IS THE PRODUCT OF MASS AND VELOCITYIN MILITARY AFFAIRS THE STRENGTH OF AN ARMY IS THE PRODUCT OF ITS MASSAND SOME UNKNOWN XMILITARY SCIENCE SEEING IN HISTORY

TRIES TO DISCOVER ITNOW IN A GEOMETRICFORMATION NOW IN THE EQUIPMENT EMPLOYED NOW AND MOST USUALLY IN THEGENIUS OF THE COMMANDERS BUT THE ASSIGNMENT OF THESE VARIOUS MEANINGSTO THE FACTOR DOES NOT YIELD RESULTS WHICH ACCORD WITH THE HISTORICFACTSYET IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO ABANDON THE FALSE VIEW ADOPTED TO GRATIFYTHE HEROES OF THE EFFICACY OF THE DIRECTIONS ISSUED IN WARTIME BYCOMMANDERS IN

LEAD MEN FORWARD UNDERFIRE MORE DISCIPLINE OBTAINABLE ONLY BY MOVEMENT IN MASSES IS NEEDEDTHAN IS NEEDED TO RESIST ATTACKS BUT THIS RULE WHICH LEAVES OUT OFACCOUNT THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY CONTINUALLY PROVES INCORRECT AND IS INPARTICULARLY STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE FACTS WHEN SOME STRONG RISE ORFALL IN THE SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS OCCURS AS IN ALL NATIONAL WARSTHE FRENCH RETREATING IN THOUGH ACCORDING TO TACTICS THEY SHOULDHAVE SEPARATED INTO DETACHMENTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVESCONGREGATED INTO AMASS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY HAD SO FALLEN THAT ONLY THE MASSHELD THE ARMY TOGETHER THE RUSSIANS ON

MORETERRIBLE TO LOOK AT THAN BEFORE HOWEVER HE DID NOT LOOK AT THEM NOWBUT THOUGHT OF OTHER THINGSONLY NOW DID PIERRE REALIZE THE FULL STRENGTH OF LIFE IN MAN AND THESAVING POWER HE HAS OF

DAYS MARCHFARTHER ON AND IN QUITE ANOTHER POSITIONONE ARMY FLED AND THE OTHER PURSUED BEYOND SMOLENSK THERE WERE SEVERALDIFFERENT ROADS AVAILABLE FOR THE FRENCH AND ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHTTHAT DURING THEIR STAY OF FOUR DAYS THEY MIGHT HAVE LEARNED WHERE THEENEMY WAS MIGHT HAVE ARRANGED SOME MORE ADVANTAGEOUS PLAN ANDUNDERTAKEN SOMETHING NEW BUT AFTER A FOUR DAYS HALT THE MOB WITH NOMANEUVERS OR

ROAD TO THE DAY THEIR LEADER FLED FROM THE ARMY NONE OF THEMOVEMENTS OF THE CROWD HAD ANY SENSE SO ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THATREGARDING THIS PERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGN THE HISTORIANS WHO ATTRIBUTED THEACTIONS OF THE MASS TO THE WILL OF ONE MAN WOULD HAVE FOUND ITIMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE STORY OF THE RETREAT FIT THEIR THEORY BUT NOMOUNTAINS OF BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY THE HISTORIANS ABOUT THISCAMPAIGN AND EVERYWHERE ARE DESCRIBED NAPOLEONS ARRANGEMENTS THEMANEUVERS AND HIS PROFOUND PLANS WHICH GUIDED THE ARMY AS WELL AS THEMILITARY GENIUS SHOWN BY HIS MARSHALSTHE RETREAT FROM

NINE TENTHS OF HIS MENAND LASTLY THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF THE GREAT EMPEROR FROM HIS HEROICARMY IS PRESENTED TO US BY THE HISTORIANS AS SOMETHING GREAT ANDCHARACTERISTIC OF GENIUS EVEN THAT FINAL

ARE ABSENTCHAPTER XIXWHAT RUSSIAN READING THE ACCOUNT OF THE LAST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN OF HAS NOT EXPERIENCED AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF REGRETDISSATISFACTION AND PERPLEXITY WHO HAS NOT ASKED HIMSELF HOW IT ISTHAT THE FRENCH WERE NOT ALL CAPTURED OR DESTROYED WHEN OUR THREE ARMIESSURROUNDED THEM IN SUPERIOR NUMBERS WHEN THE DISORDERED FRENCH HUNGRYAND FREEZING SURRENDERED IN CROWDS AND WHEN AS THE HISTORIANS RELATETHE AIM OF THE RUSSIANS WAS TO STOP THE FRENCH TO CUT THEM OFF ANDCAPTURE THEM ALLHOW WAS IT THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WHEN NUMERICALLY WEAKER THAN THEFRENCH HAD GIVEN BATTLE AT BORODINO DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE WHEN ITHAD SURROUNDED THE FRENCH ON THREE SIDES AND WHEN ITS AIM WAS TO CAPTURETHEM CAN THE FRENCH BE SO ENORMOUSLY SUPERIOR TO US THAT WHEN WE HADSURROUNDED THEM WITH SUPERIOR FORCES WE COULD NOT BEAT THEM HOW COULDTHAT HAPPENHISTORY OR WHAT IS CALLED BY THAT NAME REPLYING TO THESE QUESTIONSSAYS THAT THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE KUTUZOV AND TORMASOV AND CHICHAGOV ANDTHIS MAN AND THAT MAN DID NOT EXECUTE SUCH AND SUCH MANEUVERSBUT WHY DID THEY NOT EXECUTE THOSE MANEUVERS AND WHY IF THEY WEREGUILTY OF NOT CARRYING OUT A PREARRANGED PLAN WERE THEY NOT TRIED ANDPUNISHED BUT EVEN IF WE ADMITTED THAT KUTUZOV CHICHAGOV AND OTHERSWERE THE CAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN FAILURES IT IS STILL INCOMPREHENSIBLEWHY THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY BEING WHAT IT WAS AT KRASNOE ANDAT THE BEREZINA IN BOTH CASES WE HAD SUPERIOR FORCES THE FRENCH ARMYWITH ITS MARSHALS KINGS AND EMPEROR WAS NOT CAPTURED IF THAT WAS WHATTHE RUSSIANS AIMED ATTHE EXPLANATION OF THIS STRANGE FACT GIVEN BY RUSSIAN MILITARYHISTORIANS TO THE EFFECT THAT KUTUZOV HINDERED AN ATTACK IS UNFOUNDEDFOR WE KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE TROOPS FROM ATTACKING ATVYAZMA AND TARUTINOWHY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMYWHICH WITH INFERIOR FORCES HAD WITHSTOOD THEENEMY IN FULL STRENGTH AT BORODINODEFEATED AT KRASNOE AND THE BEREZINABY THE DISORGANIZED CROWDS OF THE FRENCH WHEN IT WAS NUMERICALLYSUPERIORIF THE AIM OF THE RUSSIANS CONSISTED IN CUTTING OFF AND CAPTURINGNAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALSAND THAT AIM WAS NOT MERELY FRUSTRATED BUTALL ATTEMPTS TO ATTAIN IT WERE MOST SHAMEFULLY BAFFLEDTHEN THIS LASTPERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGN IS QUITE RIGHTLY CONSIDERED BY THE FRENCH TO BE ASERIES OF VICTORIES AND QUITE WRONGLY CONSIDERED VICTORIOUS BY RUSSIANHISTORIANSTHE RUSSIAN MILITARY HISTORIANS IN SO FAR AS THEY SUBMIT TO CLAIMS OFLOGIC MUST ADMIT THAT CONCLUSION AND IN SPITE OF THEIR LYRICALRHAPSODIES ABOUT VALOR DEVOTION AND SO FORTH MUST RELUCTANTLY ADMITTHAT THE FRENCH RETREAT FROM MOSCOW WAS A SERIES OF VICTORIES FORNAPOLEON AND DEFEATS FOR KUTUZOVBUT PUTTING NATIONAL VANITY ENTIRELY ASIDE ONE FEELS THAT SUCH ACONCLUSION INVOLVES A CONTRADICTION SINCE THE SERIES OF FRENCHVICTORIES BROUGHT THE FRENCH COMPLETE DESTRUCTION WHILE THE SERIES OFRUSSIAN DEFEATS LED TO THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THEIR ENEMY AND THELIBERATION OF THEIR COUNTRYTHE SOURCE OF THIS CONTRADICTION LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE HISTORIANSSTUDYING THE EVENTS FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SOVEREIGNS AND THE GENERALSFROM MEMOIRS REPORTS PROJECTS AND SO FORTH HAVE ATTRIBUTED TO THISLAST PERIOD OF THE WAR OF  AN AIM THAT NEVER EXISTED NAMELY THAT OFCUTTING OFF AND CAPTURING NAPOLEON WITH HIS MARSHALS AND HIS ARMYTHERE NEVER WAS OR COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH AN AIM FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEENSENSELESS AND ITS ATTAINMENT QUITE IMPOSSIBLEIT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS FIRST BECAUSE NAPOLEONS DISORGANIZED ARMYWAS FLYING FROM RUSSIA WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED THAT IS TO SAY WASDOING JUST WHAT EVERY RUSSIAN DESIRED SO WHAT WAS THE USE OF PERFORMINGVARIOUS OPERATIONS ON THE FRENCH WHO WERE RUNNING AWAY AS FAST AS THEYPOSSIBLY COULDSECONDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS TO BLOCK THE PASSAGE OF MEN WHOSEWHOLE ENERGY WAS DIRECTED TO FLIGHTTHIRDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS TO SACRIFICE ONES OWN TROOPS INORDER TO DESTROY THE FRENCH ARMY WHICH WITHOUT EXTERNAL INTERFERENCEWAS DESTROYING ITSELF AT SUCH A RATE THAT THOUGH ITS PATH WAS NOTBLOCKED IT COULD NOT CARRY ACROSS THE FRONTIER MORE THAN IT ACTUALLYDID IN DECEMBER NAMELY A HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ORIGINAL ARMYFOURTHLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS TO WISH TO TAKE CAPTIVE THEEMPEROR KINGS AND DUKESWHOSE CAPTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE HIGHESTDEGREE EMBARRASSING FOR THE RUSSIANS AS THE MOST ADROIT DIPLOMATISTS OFTHE TIME JOSEPH DE MAISTRE AND OTHERS RECOGNIZED STILL MORE SENSELESSWOULD HAVE BEEN THE WISH TO CAPTURE ARMY CORPS OF THE FRENCH WHEN OUROWN ARMY HAD MELTED AWAY TO HALF BEFORE REACHING KRASNOE AND A WHOLEDIVISION WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED TO CONVOY THE CORPS OF PRISONERS ANDWHEN OUR MEN WERE NOT ALWAYS GETTING FULL RATIONS AND THE PRISONERSALREADY TAKEN WERE PERISHING OF HUNGERALL THE PROFOUND PLANS ABOUT CUTTING OFF AND CAPTURING NAPOLEON AND HISARMY WERE LIKE THE PLAN OF A MARKET GARDENER WHO WHEN DRIVING OUT OFHIS GARDEN A COW THAT HAD TRAMPLED DOWN THE BEDS HE HAD PLANTED SHOULDRUN TO THE GATE AND HIT THE COW ON THE HEAD THE ONLY THING TO BE SAIDIN EXCUSE OF THAT GARDENER WOULD BE THAT HE WAS VERY ANGRY BUT NOT EVENTHAT COULD BE SAID FOR THOSE WHO DREW UP THIS PROJECT FOR IT WAS NOTTHEY WHO HAD SUFFERED FROM THE TRAMPLED BEDSBUT BESIDES THE FACT THAT CUTTING OFF NAPOLEON WITH HIS ARMY WOULD HAVEBEEN SENSELESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLEIT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FIRST BECAUSEAS EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT A THREEMILEMOVEMENT OF COLUMNS ON A BATTLEFIELD NEVER COINCIDES WITH THE PLANSTHEPROBABILITY OF CHICHAGOV KUTUZOV AND WITTGENSTEIN EFFECTING A JUNCTIONON TIME AT AN APPOINTED PLACE WAS SO REMOTE AS TO BE TANTAMOUNT TOIMPOSSIBILITY AS IN FACT THOUGHT KUTUZOV WHO WHEN HE RECEIVED THE PLANREMARKED THAT DIVERSIONS PLANNED OVER GREAT DISTANCES DO NOT YIELD THEDESIRED RESULTSSECONDLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE TO PARALYZE THE MOMENTUM WITH WHICHNAPOLEONS ARMY WAS RETIRING INCOMPARABLY GREATER FORCES THAN THERUSSIANS POSSESSED WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIREDTHIRDLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE MILITARY TERM TO CUT OFF HAS NOMEANING ONE CAN CUT OFF A SLICE OF BREAD BUT NOT AN ARMY TO CUT OFFAN ARMYTO BAR ITS ROADIS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THERE IS ALWAYSPLENTY OF ROOM TO AVOID CAPTURE AND THERE IS THE NIGHT WHEN NOTHING CANBE SEEN AS THE MILITARY SCIENTISTS MIGHT CONVINCE THEMSELVES BY THEEXAMPLE OF KRASNOE AND OF THE BEREZINA IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO CAPTUREPRISONERS IF THEY AGREE TO BE CAPTURED JUST AS IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TOCATCH A SWALLOW IF IT SETTLES ON ONES HAND MEN CAN ONLY BE TAKENPRISONERS IF THEY SURRENDER ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF STRATEGY ANDTACTICS AS THE GERMANS DID BUT THE FRENCH TROOPS QUITE RIGHTLY DID NOTCONSIDER THAT THIS SUITED THEM SINCE DEATH BY HUNGER AND COLD AWAITEDTHEM IN FLIGHT OR CAPTIVITY ALIKEFOURTHLY AND CHIEFLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE NEVER SINCE THE WORLDBEGAN HAS A WAR BEEN FOUGHT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS AS THOSE THAT OBTAINEDIN  AND THE RUSSIAN ARMY IN ITS PURSUIT OF THE FRENCH STRAINED ITSSTRENGTH TO THE UTMOST AND COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYINGITSELFDURING THE MOVEMENT OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY FROM TARUTINO TO KRASNOE IT LOSTFIFTY THOUSAND SICK OR STRAGGLERS THAT IS A NUMBER EQUAL TO THEPOPULATION OF A LARGE PROVINCIAL TOWN HALF THE MEN FELL OUT OF THE ARMYWITHOUT A BATTLEAND IT IS OF THIS PERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGNWHEN THE ARMY LACKED BOOTS ANDSHEEPSKIN COATS WAS SHORT OF PROVISIONS AND WITHOUT VODKA AND WASCAMPING OUT AT NIGHT FOR MONTHS IN THE SNOW WITH FIFTEEN DEGREES OFFROST WHEN THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS OF DAYLIGHT AND THEREST WAS NIGHT IN WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF DISCIPLINE CANNOT BEMAINTAINED WHEN MEN WERE TAKEN INTO THAT REGION OF DEATH WHEREDISCIPLINE FAILS NOT FOR A FEW HOURS ONLY AS IN A BATTLE BUT FORMONTHS WHERE THEY WERE EVERY MOMENT FIGHTING DEATH FROM HUNGER ANDCOLD WHEN HALF THE ARMY PERISHED IN A SINGLE MONTHIT IS OF THISPERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT THE HISTORIANS TELL US HOW MILORADOVICHSHOULD HAVE MADE A FLANK MARCH TO SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE TORMASOV TOANOTHER PLACE AND CHICHAGOV SHOULD HAVE CROSSED MORE THAN KNEEDEEP INSNOW TO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HOW SOANDSO ROUTED AND CUT OFF THEFRENCH AND SO ON AND SO ONTHE RUSSIANS HALF OF WHOM DIED DID ALL THAT COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEENDONE TO ATTAIN AN END WORTHY OF THE NATION AND THEY ARE NOT TO BLAMEBECAUSE OTHER RUSSIANS SITTING IN WARM ROOMS PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULDDO WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLEALL THAT STRANGE CONTRADICTION NOW DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BETWEEN THEFACTS AND THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS ONLY ARISES BECAUSE THE HISTORIANSDEALING WITH THE MATTER HAVE WRITTEN THE HISTORY OF THE BEAUTIFUL WORDSAND SENTIMENTS OF VARIOUS GENERALS AND NOT THE HISTORY OF THE EVENTSTO THEM THE WORDS OF MILORADOVICH SEEM VERY INTERESTING AND SO DO THEIRSURMISES AND THE REWARDS THIS OR THAT GENERAL RECEIVED BUT THE QUESTIONOF THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND MEN WHO WERE LEFT IN HOSPITALS AND IN GRAVESDOES NOT EVEN INTEREST THEM FOR IT DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE RANGE OFTHEIR INVESTIGATIONYET ONE NEED ONLY DISCARD THE STUDY OF THE REPORTS AND GENERAL PLANS ANDCONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO TOOK ADIRECT PART IN THE EVENTS AND ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT SEEMED INSOLUBLEEASILY AND SIMPLY RECEIVE AN IMMEDIATE AND CERTAIN SOLUTIONTHE AIM OF CUTTING OFF NAPOLEON AND HIS ARMY NEVER EXISTED EXCEPT IN THEIMAGINATIONS OF A DOZEN PEOPLE IT COULD NOT EXIST BECAUSE IT WASSENSELESS AND UNATTAINABLETHE PEOPLE HAD A SINGLE AIM TO FREE THEIR LAND FROM INVASION THAT AIMWAS ATTAINED IN THE FIRST PLACE OF ITSELF AS THE FRENCH RAN AWAY ANDSO IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY NOT TO STOP THEIR FLIGHT SECONDLY IT WASATTAINED BY THE GUERRILLA WARFARE WHICH WAS DESTROYING THE FRENCH ANDTHIRDLY BY THE FACT THAT A LARGE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS FOLLOWING THE FRENCHREADY TO USE ITS STRENGTH IN CASE THEIR MOVEMENT STOPPEDTHE RUSSIAN ARMY HAD TO ACT LIKE A WHIP TO A RUNNING ANIMAL AND THEEXPERIENCED DRIVER KNEW IT WAS BETTER TO HOLD THE WHIP RAISED AS AMENACE THAN TO STRIKE THE RUNNING ANIMAL ON THE HEADBOOK FIFTEEN   CHAPTER IWHEN SEEING A DYING ANIMAL A MAN

FLEEING FRENCH AND OF THE RUSSIANSWHO PURSUED THEM CONTINUED AS FAR AS KRASNOE WITHOUT A BATTLE THEFLIGHT WAS SO RAPID THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY PURSUING THE FRENCH COULD NOTKEEP UP WITH THEM CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY HORSES BROKE DOWN AND THEINFORMATION RECEIVED OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH WAS NEVER RELIABLETHE MEN IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY WERE SO WORN OUT BY THIS CONTINUOUS MARCHINGAT THE RATE OF TWENTYSEVEN MILES A DAY THAT THEY COULD NOT GO ANYFASTERTO REALIZE THE DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY IT IS ONLYNECESSARY TO GRASP CLEARLY THE MEANING OF THE FACT THAT WHILE NOTLOSING MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND KILLED AND WOUNDED AFTER TARUTINO ANDLESS THAN A HUNDRED PRISONERS THE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH LEFT THAT PLACE AHUNDRED THOUSAND STRONG REACHED KRASNOE WITH ONLY FIFTY THOUSANDTHE RAPIDITY OF THE RUSSIAN PURSUIT WAS JUST AS DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR ARMYAS THE FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH WAS TO THEIRS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THATTHE RUSSIAN ARMY MOVED VOLUNTARILY WITH NO SUCH THREAT OF DESTRUCTIONAS HUNG OVER THE FRENCH AND THAT THE SICK FRENCHMEN WERE LEFT BEHIND INENEMY HANDS WHILE THE SICK RUSSIANS LEFT BEHIND WERE AMONG THEIR OWNPEOPLE THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE WASTAGE OF NAPOLEONS ARMY WAS THERAPIDITY OF ITS MOVEMENT AND A CONVINCING PROOF OF THIS IS THECORRESPONDING DECREASE OF THE RUSSIAN ARMYKUTUZOV AS FAR AS WAS IN HIS POWER INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CHECK THEMOVEMENT OF THE FRENCH AS WAS DESIRED IN PETERSBURG AND BY THE RUSSIANARMY GENERALS DIRECTED HIS WHOLE ACTIVITY HERE AS HE HAD DONE ATTARUTINO AND VYAZMA TO HASTENING IT ON WHILE EASING THE MOVEMENT OF OURARMYBUT BESIDES THIS SINCE THE EXHAUSTION AND ENORMOUS DIMINUTION OF THEARMY CAUSED BY THE RAPIDITY OF THE ADVANCE HAD BECOME EVIDENT ANOTHERREASON FOR SLACKENING THE PACE AND DELAYING PRESENTED ITSELF TO KUTUZOVTHE AIM OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS TO PURSUE THE FRENCH THE ROAD THEFRENCH WOULD TAKE WAS UNKNOWN AND SO THE CLOSER OUR TROOPS TROD ONTHEIR HEELS THE GREATER DISTANCE THEY HAD TO COVER ONLY BY FOLLOWING ATSOME DISTANCE COULD ONE CUT ACROSS THE ZIGZAG PATH OF THE FRENCH ALLTHE ARTFUL MANEUVERS SUGGESTED BY OUR GENERALS MEANT FRESH MOVEMENTS OFTHE ARMY AND A LENGTHENING OF ITS MARCHES WHEREAS THE ONLY REASONABLEAIM WAS TO SHORTEN THOSE MARCHES TO THAT END KUTUZOVS ACTIVITY WASDIRECTED DURING THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN FROM MOSCOW TO VILNANOT CASUALLY ORINTERMITTENTLY BUT SO CONSISTENTLY THAT HE NEVER ONCE DEVIATED FROM ITKUTUZOV FELT AND KNEWNOT BY REASONING OR SCIENCE BUT WITH THE WHOLE OFHIS RUSSIAN BEINGWHAT EVERY RUSSIAN SOLDIER FELT THAT THE FRENCH WEREBEATEN THAT THE ENEMY WAS FLYING AND MUST BE DRIVEN OUT BUT AT THESAME TIME HE LIKE THE SOLDIERS REALIZED ALL THE HARDSHIP OF THIS MARCHTHE RAPIDITY OF WHICH WAS UNPARALLELED FOR SUCH A TIME OF THE YEARBUT TO THE GENERALS ESPECIALLY THE FOREIGN ONES IN THE RUSSIAN ARMYWHO WISHED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES TO ASTONISH SOMEBODY AND FOR SOMEREASON TO CAPTURE A KING OR A DUKEIT SEEMED THAT NOWWHEN ANY BATTLEMUST BE HORRIBLE AND

BUT BLIND TOOLS OF THEMOST MELANCHOLY LAW OF NECESSITY BUT CONSIDERED THEMSELVES HEROES ANDIMAGINED THAT THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHING A MOST NOBLE AND HONORABLE DEEDTHEY BLAMED KUTUZOV AND SAID THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THECAMPAIGN HE HAD PREVENTED THEIR VANQUISHING NAPOLEON THAT HE THOUGHT OFNOTHING BUT SATISFYING HIS PASSIONS AND WOULD NOT ADVANCE FROM THE LINENFACTORIES BECAUSE HE WAS COMFORTABLE THERE THAT AT KRASNOE HE CHECKEDTHE ADVANCE BECAUSE ON LEARNING THAT NAPOLEON WAS THERE HE HAD QUITELOST HIS HEAD AND THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT HE HAD AN UNDERSTANDINGWITH NAPOLEON AND HAD BEEN BRIBED BY HIM AND SO ON AND SO ONNOT ONLY DID HIS CONTEMPORARIES CARRIED AWAY BY THEIR PASSIONS TALK INTHIS WAY BUT POSTERITY AND HISTORY HAVE ACCLAIMED NAPOLEON AS GRANDWHILE KUTUZOV IS DESCRIBED BY FOREIGNERS AS A CRAFTY DISSOLUTE WEAKOLD COURTIER AND BY RUSSIANS AS SOMETHING INDEFINITEA SORT OF PUPPETUSEFUL ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD A RUSSIAN NAMECHAPTER VIN  AND  KUTUZOV WAS OPENLY ACCUSED OF BLUNDERING THE EMPERORWAS DISSATISFIED WITH HIM AND IN A HISTORY RECENTLY WRITTEN BY ORDER OFTHE HIGHEST AUTHORITIES IT IS SAID THAT KUTUZOV WAS A CUNNING COURTLIAR FRIGHTENED OF THE NAME OF NAPOLEON AND THAT BY HIS BLUNDERS ATKRASNOE AND THE BEREZINA HE DEPRIVED THE RUSSIAN ARMY OF THE GLORY OFCOMPLETE VICTORY OVER THE FRENCH  HISTORY OF THE YEAR  THE CHARACTER OF KUTUZOV AND REFLECTIONS ONTHE UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS OF THE BATTLES AT KRASNOE BY BOGDANOVICHSUCH IS THE FATE NOT OF GREAT MEN GRANDS HOMMES WHOM THE RUSSIAN MINDDOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE BUT OF THOSE RARE AND ALWAYS SOLITARY INDIVIDUALSWHO DISCERNING THE WILL OF PROVIDENCE SUBMIT THEIR PERSONAL WILL TOIT THE HATRED AND CONTEMPT OF THE CROWD PUNISH SUCH MEN FOR DISCERNINGTHE HIGHER LAWSFOR RUSSIAN HISTORIANS STRANGE AND TERRIBLE TO SAY NAPOLEONTHAT MOSTINSIGNIFICANT TOOL OF HISTORY WHO NEVER ANYWHERE EVEN IN EXILE SHOWEDHUMAN DIGNITYNAPOLEON IS THE OBJECT OF ADULATION AND ENTHUSIASM HE ISGRAND BUT KUTUZOVTHE MAN WHO FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF HISACTIVITY IN  NEVER ONCE SWERVING BY WORD OR DEED FROM BORODINO TOVILNA PRESENTED AN EXAMPLE EXCEPTIONAL IN HISTORY OF SELFSACRIFICE ANDA PRESENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE FUTURE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENINGKUTUZOV SEEMS TO THEM SOMETHING INDEFINITE AND PITIFUL AND WHENSPEAKING OF HIM AND OF THE YEAR  THEY ALWAYS SEEM A LITTLE ASHAMEDAND YET IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE AN HISTORICAL CHARACTER WHOSEACTIVITY WAS SO UNSWERVINGLY DIRECTED TO A SINGLE AIM AND IT WOULD BEDIFFICULT TO IMAGINE ANY AIM MORE WORTHY OR MORE CONSONANT WITH THE WILLOF THE WHOLE PEOPLE STILL MORE DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO FIND ANINSTANCE IN HISTORY OF THE AIM OF AN HISTORICAL PERSONAGE BEING SOCOMPLETELY ACCOMPLISHED AS THAT TO WHICH ALL KUTUZOVS EFFORTS WEREDIRECTED IN KUTUZOV NEVER TALKED OF FORTY CENTURIES LOOKING DOWN FROM THEPYRAMIDS OF THE SACRIFICES HE OFFERED FOR THE FATHERLAND OR OF WHATHE INTENDED TO ACCOMPLISH OR HAD ACCOMPLISHED IN GENERAL HE SAIDNOTHING

THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FROM WHICH TIME HIS DISAGREEMENTWITH THOSE ABOUT HIM BEGAN HE ALONE SAID THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINOWAS A VICTORY AND REPEATED THIS BOTH VERBALLY AND IN HIS DISPATCHES ANDREPORTS UP TO THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE ALONE SAID THAT THE LOSS OFMOSCOW IS NOT THE LOSS OF RUSSIA IN REPLY TO LAURISTONS PROPOSAL OFPEACE HE SAID THERE CAN BE NO PEACE FOR SUCH IS THE PEOPLES WILL HEALONE DURING THE RETREAT OF THE FRENCH SAID THAT ALL OUR MANEUVERS AREUSELESS EVERYTHING IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED OF ITSELF BETTER THAN WE COULDDESIRE THAT THE ENEMY MUST BE OFFERED A GOLDEN BRIDGE

MATHEMATICALPROGRESSION AND THAT CROSSING OF THE BEREZINA ABOUT WHICH SO MUCH HASBEEN WRITTEN WAS ONLY ONE INTERMEDIATE STAGE IN ITS DESTRUCTION AND NOTAT ALL THE DECISIVE EPISODE OF THE CAMPAIGN IF SO MUCH HAS BEEN ANDSTILL IS WRITTEN ABOUT THE BEREZINA ON THE FRENCH SIDE THIS IS ONLYBECAUSE AT THE BROKEN BRIDGE ACROSS THAT RIVER THE CALAMITIES THEIR ARMYHAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ENDURING WERE SUDDENLY CONCENTRATED AT ONE MOMENTINTO A TRAGIC SPECTACLE THAT REMAINED IN EVERY MEMORY AND ON THERUSSIAN SIDE MERELY BECAUSE IN PETERSBURGFAR FROM THE SEAT OF WARAPLAN AGAIN ONE OF PFUELS HAD BEEN DEVISED TO CATCH NAPOLEON IN ASTRATEGIC TRAP AT THE BEREZINA RIVER EVERYONE ASSURED HIMSELF THAT ALLWOULD HAPPEN ACCORDING TO PLAN AND THEREFORE INSISTED THAT IT WAS JUSTTHE CROSSING OF THE BEREZINA THAT DESTROYED THE FRENCH ARMY IN REALITYTHE RESULTS OF THE CROSSING WERE MUCH LESS DISASTROUS TO THE FRENCHINGUNS AND MEN LOSTTHAN KRASNOE HAD BEEN AS THE FIGURES SHOWTHE SOLE IMPORTANCE OF THE CROSSING OF THE BEREZINA LIES IN THE FACTTHAT IT PLAINLY AND INDUBITABLY PROVED THE FALLACY OF ALL THE PLANS FORCUTTING OFF THE ENEMYS RETREAT AND THE SOUNDNESS OF THE ONLY POSSIBLELINE OF ACTIONTHE ONE KUTUZOV AND THE GENERAL MASS OF THE ARMYDEMANDEDNAMELY SIMPLY TO FOLLOW THE ENEMY UP THE FRENCH CROWD FLEDAT A CONTINUALLY INCREASING SPEED AND ALL ITS ENERGY WAS DIRECTED TOREACHING ITS GOAL IT FLED LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLETO BLOCK ITS PATH THIS WAS SHOWN NOT SO MUCH BY THE ARRANGEMENTS ITMADE FOR CROSSING AS BY WHAT TOOK PLACE AT THE BRIDGES WHEN THE BRIDGESBROKE DOWN UNARMED SOLDIERS PEOPLE FROM MOSCOW AND WOMEN WITH CHILDRENWHO WERE WITH THE FRENCH TRANSPORT ALLCARRIED ON BY VIS INERTIAEPRESSED FORWARD INTO BOATS AND INTO THE ICECOVERED WATER AND DID NOTSURRENDERTHAT IMPULSE WAS REASONABLE THE CONDITION OF FUGITIVES AND OF PURSUERSWAS EQUALLY BAD AS LONG AS THEY REMAINED WITH THEIR OWN PEOPLE EACHMIGHT HOPE FOR HELP FROM HIS FELLOWS AND THE DEFINITE PLACE HE HELDAMONG THEM BUT THOSE WHO SURRENDERED WHILE REMAINING IN THE SAMEPITIFUL PLIGHT WOULD BE ON A LOWER LEVEL TO CLAIM A SHARE IN THENECESSITIES OF LIFE THE FRENCH DID NOT NEED TO BE INFORMED OF THE FACTTHAT HALF THE PRISONERSWITH WHOM THE RUSSIANS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DOPERISHED OF COLD AND HUNGER DESPITE THEIR CAPTORS DESIRE TO SAVE THEMTHEY FELT THAT IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THE MOST COMPASSIONATE RUSSIANCOMMANDERS THOSE FAVORABLE TO THE FRENCHAND EVEN THE FRENCHMEN IN THERUSSIAN SERVICECOULD DO NOTHING FOR THE PRISONERS THE FRENCH PERISHEDFROM THE CONDITIONS TO WHICH THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS ITSELF EXPOSED IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE BREAD AND CLOTHES FROM OUR HUNGRY AND INDISPENSABLESOLDIERS TO GIVE TO THE FRENCH WHO THOUGH NOT HARMFUL OR HATED ORGUILTY WERE SIMPLY UNNECESSARY SOME RUSSIANS EVEN DID THAT BUT THEYWERE EXCEPTIONSCERTAIN DESTRUCTION LAY BEHIND THE FRENCH BUT IN FRONT THERE WAS HOPETHEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN BURNED THERE WAS NO SALVATION SAVE IN COLLECTIVEFLIGHT AND ON THAT THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF THE FRENCH WAS CONCENTRATEDTHE FARTHER THEY FLED THE MORE WRETCHED BECAME THE PLIGHT OF THEREMNANT ESPECIALLY AFTER THE BEREZINA ON WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEPETERSBURG PLAN SPECIAL HOPES HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE RUSSIANS AND THEKEENER GREW THE PASSIONS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS WHO BLAMED ONEANOTHER AND KUTUZOV MOST OF ALL ANTICIPATION THAT THE FAILURE OF THEPETERSBURG BEREZINA PLAN WOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO KUTUZOV LED TODISSATISFACTION CONTEMPT AND RIDICULE MORE AND MORE STRONGLYEXPRESSED THE RIDICULE AND CONTEMPT WERE OF COURSE EXPRESSED IN ARESPECTFUL FORM MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ASK WHEREIN HE WAS TOBLAME THEY DID NOT TALK SERIOUSLY TO HIM WHEN REPORTING TO HIM ORASKING FOR HIS SANCTION THEY APPEARED TO BE FULFILLING A REGRETTABLEFORMALITY BUT THEY WINKED BEHIND HIS BACK AND TRIED TO MISLEAD HIM ATEVERY TURNBECAUSE THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM ALL THESE PEOPLE ASSUMED THAT ITWAS USELESS TO TALK TO THE OLD MAN THAT HE WOULD NEVER GRASP THEPROFUNDITY OF THEIR PLANS THAT HE WOULD ANSWER WITH HIS PHRASES WHICHTHEY THOUGHT WERE MERE PHRASES ABOUT A GOLDEN BRIDGE ABOUT THEIMPOSSIBILITY OF CROSSING THE FRONTIER WITH A CROWD OF TATTERDEMALIONSAND SO FORTH THEY HAD HEARD ALL THAT BEFORE AND ALL HE SAIDTHAT ITWAS NECESSARY TO AWAIT PROVISIONS OR THAT THE MEN HAD NO BOOTSWAS SOSIMPLE WHILE WHAT THEY PROPOSED WAS SO COMPLICATED AND CLEVER THAT ITWAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS OLD AND STUPID AND THAT THEY THOUGH NOT INPOWER WERE COMMANDERS OF GENIUSAFTER THE JUNCTION WITH THE ARMY OF THE BRILLIANT ADMIRAL

ABANDONMENT OF MOSCOW NOW REALIZED ATONCE THAT HIS DAY WAS OVER THAT HIS PART WAS PLAYED AND THAT THE POWERHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HOLD WAS NO LONGER HIS AND HE UNDERSTOOD THIS NOTMERELY FROM THE ATTITUDE OF THE COURT HE SAW ON THE ONE HAND THAT THEMILITARY BUSINESS IN WHICH HE HAD PLAYED HIS PART WAS ENDED AND FELTTHAT HIS MISSION WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND AT THE SAME TIME HE BEGAN TO BECONSCIOUS OF THE

BUTNEVER WISHED TO GO WHERE HE WAS SENT CHICHAGOV NOTED FOR THE BOLDNESSWITH WHICH HE SPOKE TO THE EMPEROR AND WHO CONSIDERED KUTUZOV TO BEUNDER AN OBLIGATION TO HIM BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS SENT TO MAKE

CONTEMPTUOUSLYRESPECTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE YOUNGER MEN TO THE OLD MAN IN HIS DOTAGE WASEXPRESSED IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE BY THE BEHAVIOR OF CHICHAGOV WHO KNEWOF THE ACCUSATIONS THAT WERE BEING DIRECTED AGAINST KUTUZOVWHEN SPEAKING TO CHICHAGOV KUTUZOV INCIDENTALLY MENTIONED THAT THEVEHICLES PACKED WITH CHINA THAT HAD BEEN CAPTURED FROM HIM AT BORISOVHAD BEEN RECOVERED AND WOULD BE RESTORED TO HIMYOU

OFFICERS AND THE SEMENOV GUARD AND AGAINPRESSING THE OLD MANS HAND WENT WITH HIM INTO THE CASTLEWHEN ALONE WITH THE FIELD MARSHAL THE EMPEROR EXPRESSED HISDISSATISFACTION AT THE SLOWNESS OF THE PURSUIT AND AT THE MISTAKES MADEAT KRASNOE AND THE BEREZINA AND INFORMED HIM OF HIS INTENTIONS FOR AFUTURE CAMPAIGN ABROAD KUTUZOV MADE NO REJOINDER OR REMARK THE SAMESUBMISSIVE EXPRESSIONLESS LOOK WITH WHICH HE HAD LISTENED TO THEEMPERORS COMMANDS ON THE FIELD OF AUSTERLITZ SEVEN YEARS BEFORE SETTLEDON HIS FACE NOWWHEN KUTUZOV CAME OUT OF THE STUDY AND WITH LOWERED HEAD WAS CROSSINGTHE BALLROOM WITH HIS HEAVY WADDLING GAIT HE WAS ARRESTED BY SOMEONESVOICE SAYINGYOUR SERENE HIGHNESSKUTUZOV RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED FOR A LONG WHILE INTO THE EYES OFCOUNT TOLSTOY WHO STOOD BEFORE HIM HOLDING A SILVER SALVER ON WHICH LAYA SMALL OBJECT KUTUZOV SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OFHIMSUDDENLY HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE FLASHEDACROSS HIS PUFFY FACE AND BOWING LOW AND RESPECTFULLY HE TOOK THEOBJECT THAT LAY ON THE SALVER IT WAS THE ORDER OF ST GEORGE OF THEFIRST CLASSCHAPTER XINEXT DAY THE FIELD MARSHAL GAVE A DINNER AND BALL WHICH THE EMPERORHONORED BY HIS PRESENCE KUTUZOV HAD RECEIVED THE ORDER OF ST GEORGE OFTHE FIRST CLASS AND THE EMPEROR SHOWED HIM THE HIGHEST HONORS BUTEVERYONE KNEW OF THE IMPERIAL DISSATISFACTION WITH HIM THE PROPRIETIESWERE OBSERVED AND THE EMPEROR WAS THE FIRST TO SET THAT EXAMPLE BUTEVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE OLD MAN WAS BLAMEWORTHY AND GOODFORNOTHING WHEN KUTUZOV CONFORMING TO A CUSTOM OF CATHERINES DAYORDERED THE STANDARDS THAT HAD BEEN CAPTURED TO BE LOWERED AT THEEMPERORS FEET ON HIS ENTERING THE BALLROOM THE EMPEROR MADE A WRY FACEAND MUTTERED SOMETHING IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE CAUGHT THE WORDS THE OLDCOMEDIANTHE EMPERORS DISPLEASURE WITH KUTUZOV WAS SPECIALLY INCREASED AT VILNABY THE FACT THAT KUTUZOV EVIDENTLY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIMPORTANCE OF THE COMING CAMPAIGNWHEN ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE EMPEROR SAID TO THE OFFICERS ASSEMBLEDABOUT HIM YOU HAVE NOT ONLY SAVED RUSSIA YOU HAVE SAVED EUROPE THEYALL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WAR WAS NOT ENDEDKUTUZOV ALONE WOULD NOT SEE THIS AND OPENLY EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THATNO FRESH WAR COULD IMPROVE THE POSITION OR ADD TO THE GLORY OF RUSSIABUT COULD ONLY SPOIL AND LOWER THE GLORIOUS POSITION THAT RUSSIA HADGAINED HE TRIED TO PROVE TO THE EMPEROR THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF LEVYINGFRESH TROOPS SPOKE OF THE HARDSHIPS ALREADY ENDURED BY THE PEOPLE OFTHE POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE AND SO FORTHTHIS BEING THE FIELD MARSHALS FRAME OF MIND HE WAS NATURALLY REGARDEDAS MERELY A HINDRANCE AND OBSTACLE TO THE IMPENDING WARTO AVOID UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTERS WITH THE OLD MAN THE NATURAL METHOD WASTO DO WHAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH HIM AT AUSTERLITZ AND WITH BARCLAY AT THEBEGINNING OF THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGNTO TRANSFER THE AUTHORITY TO THEEMPEROR HIMSELF THUS CUTTING THE GROUND FROM UNDER THE COMMANDER INCHIEFS FEET WITHOUT UPSETTING THE OLD MAN BY INFORMING HIM OF THECHANGEWITH THIS OBJECT HIS STAFF WAS GRADUALLY RECONSTRUCTED AND ITS REALSTRENGTH REMOVED AND TRANSFERRED TO THE EMPEROR TOLL KONOVNITSYN ANDERMOLOV RECEIVED FRESH APPOINTMENTS EVERYONE SPOKE LOUDLY OF THE FIELDMARSHALS GREAT WEAKNESS AND FAILING HEALTHHIS HEALTH HAD TO BE BAD FOR HIS PLACE TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND GIVEN TOANOTHER AND IN FACT HIS HEALTH WAS POORSO NATURALLY SIMPLY AND GRADUALLYJUST AS HE HAD COME FROM TURKEY TOTHE TREASURY IN PETERSBURG TO RECRUIT THE MILITIA AND THEN TO THE ARMYWHEN HE WAS NEEDED THERENOW WHEN HIS PART WAS PLAYED OUT KUTUZOVSPLACE WAS TAKEN BY A NEW AND NECESSARY PERFORMERTHE WAR OF  BESIDES ITS NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE DEAR TO EVERY RUSSIANHEART WAS NOW TO ASSUME ANOTHER A EUROPEAN SIGNIFICANCETHE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES FROM WEST TO EAST WAS TO BE SUCCEEDED BY AMOVEMENT OF PEOPLES FROM EAST TO WEST AND FOR THIS FRESH WAR ANOTHERLEADER WAS NECESSARY HAVING QUALITIES AND VIEWS DIFFERING FROMKUTUZOVS AND ANIMATED BY DIFFERENT MOTIVESALEXANDER I WAS AS NECESSARY FOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES FROM EASTTO WEST AND FOR THE REFIXING OF NATIONAL FRONTIERS AS KUTUZOV HAD BEENFOR THE SALVATION AND GLORY OF RUSSIAKUTUZOV DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT EUROPE THE BALANCE OF POWER ORNAPOLEON MEANT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OFTHE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AFTER THE ENEMY HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND RUSSIA HADBEEN LIBERATED AND RAISED TO THE SUMMIT OF HER GLORY THERE WAS NOTHINGLEFT TO DO AS A RUSSIAN NOTHING REMAINED FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THENATIONAL WAR BUT TO DIE AND KUTUZOV DIEDCHAPTER XIIAS GENERALLY HAPPENS PIERRE DID NOT FEEL THE FULL EFFECTS OF THEPHYSICAL PRIVATION AND STRAIN HE HAD SUFFERED AS PRISONER UNTIL AFTERTHEY WERE OVER AFTER HIS LIBERATION HE REACHED OREL AND ON THE THIRDDAY THERE WHEN PREPARING TO GO TO KIEV HE FELL ILL AND WAS LAID UP FORTHREE MONTHS HE HAD WHAT THE DOCTORS TERMED BILIOUS FEVER BUTDESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DOCTORS TREATED HIM BLED HIM AND GAVE HIMMEDICINES TO DRINK HE RECOVEREDSCARCELY ANY IMPRESSION WAS LEFT ON PIERRES MIND BY ALL THAT HAPPENEDTO HIM FROM THE TIME OF HIS RESCUE TILL HIS ILLNESS HE REMEMBERED ONLYTHE DULL GRAY WEATHER NOW RAINY AND NOW SNOWY INTERNAL PHYSICALDISTRESS AND PAINS IN HIS FEET AND SIDE HE REMEMBERED A GENERALIMPRESSION OF THE MISFORTUNES AND SUFFERINGS OF PEOPLE AND OF BEINGWORRIED BY THE CURIOSITY OF OFFICERS AND GENERALS WHO QUESTIONED HIM HEALSO REMEMBERED HIS DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING A CONVEYANCE AND HORSES ANDABOVE ALL HE REMEMBERED HIS INCAPACITY TO THINK AND FEEL ALL THAT TIMEON THE DAY OF HIS RESCUE HE HAD SEEN THE BODY OF PETYA ROSTOV THAT SAMEDAY HE HAD LEARNED THAT PRINCE ANDREW AFTER SURVIVING THE BATTLE OFBORODINO FOR MORE THAN A MONTH HAD RECENTLY DIED IN THE ROSTOVS HOUSEAT YAROSLAVL AND DENISOV WHO TOLD HIM THIS NEWS ALSO MENTIONED HELENESDEATH SUPPOSING THAT PIERRE HAD HEARD OF IT LONG BEFORE ALL THIS ATTHE TIME SEEMED MERELY STRANGE TO PIERRE HE FELT HE COULD NOT GRASP ITSSIGNIFICANCE JUST THEN HE WAS ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY AS QUICKLY ASPOSSIBLE FROM PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WERE KILLING ONE ANOTHER TO SOMEPEACEFUL REFUGE WHERE HE COULD RECOVER HIMSELF REST AND THINK OVER ALLTHE STRANGE NEW FACTS HE HAD LEARNED BUT ON REACHING OREL HEIMMEDIATELY FELL ILL WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF AFTER HIS ILLNESS HE SAWIN ATTENDANCE ON HIM TWO OF HIS SERVANTS TERENTY AND VASKA WHO HADCOME FROM MOSCOW AND ALSO HIS COUSIN THE ELDEST PRINCESS WHO HAD BEENLIVING ON HIS ESTATE AT ELETS AND HEARING OF HIS RESCUE AND ILLNESS HADCOME TO LOOK AFTER HIMIT WAS ONLY GRADUALLY DURING HIS CONVALESCENCE THAT PIERRE LOST THEIMPRESSIONS HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS ANDGOT USED TO THE IDEA THAT NO ONE WOULD OBLIGE HIM TO GO ANYWHERETOMORROW THAT NO ONE WOULD DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS WARM BED AND THAT HEWOULD BE SURE TO GET HIS DINNER TEA AND SUPPER BUT FOR A LONG TIME INHIS DREAMS HE STILL SAW HIMSELF IN THE CONDITIONS OF CAPTIVITY IN THESAME WAY LITTLE BY LITTLE HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE NEWS HE HAD BEENTOLD AFTER HIS RESCUE ABOUT THE DEATH OF PRINCE ANDREW THE DEATH OFHIS WIFE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCHA JOYOUS FEELING OF FREEDOMTHAT COMPLETE INALIENABLE FREEDOM NATURALTO MAN WHICH HE HAD FIRST EXPERIENCED AT THE FIRST HALT OUTSIDE MOSCOWFILLED PIERRES SOUL DURING HIS CONVALESCENCE HE WAS SURPRISED TO FINDTHAT THIS INNER FREEDOM WHICH WAS INDEPENDENT OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONSNOW HAD AS IT WERE AN ADDITIONAL SETTING OF EXTERNAL LIBERTY HE WASALONE IN A STRANGE TOWN WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCES NO ONE DEMANDED ANYTHINGOF HIM OR SENT HIM ANYWHERE HE HAD ALL HE WANTED THE THOUGHT OF HISWIFE WHICH HAD BEEN A CONTINUAL TORMENT TO HIM WAS NO LONGER THERESINCE SHE WAS NO MOREOH HOW GOOD HOW SPLENDID SAID HE TO HIMSELF WHEN A CLEANLY LAIDTABLE WAS MOVED UP TO HIM WITH SAVORY BEEF TEA OR WHEN HE LAY DOWN FORTHE NIGHT ON A SOFT CLEAN BED OR WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE FRENCH HADGONE AND THAT HIS WIFE WAS NO MORE OH HOW GOOD HOW SPLENDIDAND BY OLD HABIT HE ASKED HIMSELF THE QUESTION WELL AND WHAT THENWHAT AM I GOING TO DO AND HE IMMEDIATELY GAVE HIMSELF THE ANSWERWELL I SHALL LIVE AH HOW SPLENDIDTHE VERY QUESTION THAT HAD FORMERLY TORMENTED HIM THE THING HE HADCONTINUALLY SOUGHT TO FINDTHE AIM OF LIFENO LONGER EXISTED FOR HIMNOW THAT SEARCH FOR THE AIM OF LIFE HAD NOT MERELY DISAPPEAREDTEMPORARILYHE FELT THAT IT NO LONGER EXISTED FOR HIM AND COULD NOTPRESENT ITSELF AGAIN AND THIS VERY ABSENCE OF AN AIM GAVE HIM THECOMPLETE JOYOUS SENSE OF FREEDOM WHICH CONSTITUTED HIS HAPPINESS ATTHIS TIMEHE COULD NOT SEE AN AIM FOR HE NOW HAD FAITHNOT FAITH IN ANY KIND OFRULE OR WORDS OR IDEAS BUT FAITH IN AN EVERLIVING EVERMANIFESTGOD FORMERLY HE HAD SOUGHT HIM IN AIMS HE SET HIMSELF THAT SEARCH FORAN AIM HAD BEEN SIMPLY A SEARCH FOR GOD AND SUDDENLY IN HIS CAPTIVITYHE HAD LEARNED NOT BY WORDS OR REASONING BUT BY DIRECT FEELING WHAT HISNURSE HAD TOLD HIM LONG AGO THAT GOD IS HERE AND EVERYWHERE IN HISCAPTIVITY HE HAD LEARNED THAT IN KARATAEV GOD WAS GREATER MORE INFINITEAND UNFATHOMABLE THAN IN THE ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE RECOGNIZED BY THEFREEMASONS HE FELT LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER STRAINING HIS EYES TO SEE INTOTHE FAR DISTANCE FINDS WHAT HE SOUGHT AT HIS VERY FEET ALL HIS LIFE HEHAD LOOKED OVER THE HEADS OF THE MEN AROUND HIM WHEN HE SHOULD HAVEMERELY LOOKED IN FRONT OF HIM WITHOUT STRAINING HIS EYESIN THE PAST HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND THAT GREAT INSCRUTABLEINFINITE SOMETHING HE HAD ONLY FELT THAT IT MUST EXIST SOMEWHERE ANDHAD LOOKED FOR IT IN EVERYTHING NEAR AND COMPREHENSIBLE HE HAD ONLYWHAT WAS LIMITED PETTY COMMONPLACE AND SENSELESS HE HAD EQUIPPEDHIMSELF WITH A MENTAL TELESCOPE AND LOOKED INTO REMOTE SPACE WHEREPETTY WORLDLINESS HIDING ITSELF IN MISTY DISTANCE HAD SEEMED TO HIMGREAT AND INFINITE MERELY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CLEARLY SEEN AND SUCH HADEUROPEAN LIFE POLITICS FREEMASONRY PHILOSOPHY AND PHILANTHROPYSEEMED TO HIM BUT EVEN THEN AT MOMENTS OF WEAKNESS AS HE HAD ACCOUNTEDTHEM HIS MIND HAD PENETRATED TO THOSE DISTANCES AND HE HAD THERE SEENTHE SAME PETTINESS WORLDLINESS AND SENSELESSNESS NOW HOWEVER HE HADLEARNED TO SEE THE GREAT ETERNAL AND INFINITE IN EVERYTHING ANDTHEREFORETO SEE IT AND ENJOY ITS CONTEMPLATIONHE NATURALLY THREWAWAY THE TELESCOPE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD TILL NOW GAZED OVER MENS HEADSAND GLADLY REGARDED THE EVERCHANGING ETERNALLY GREAT UNFATHOMABLEAND INFINITE LIFE AROUND HIM AND THE CLOSER HE LOOKED THE MORE TRANQUILAND HAPPY HE BECAME THAT DREADFUL QUESTION WHAT FOR WHICH HADFORMERLY DESTROYED ALL HIS MENTAL EDIFICES NO LONGER EXISTED FOR HIMTO THAT QUESTION WHAT FOR A SIMPLE ANSWER WAS NOW ALWAYS READY INHIS SOUL BECAUSE THERE IS A GOD THAT GOD WITHOUT WHOSE WILL NOT ONEHAIR FALLS FROM A MANS HEADCHAPTER XIIIIN EXTERNAL WAYS PIERRE HAD HARDLY CHANGED AT ALL IN APPEARANCE HE WASJUST WHAT HE USED TO BE AS BEFORE HE WAS ABSENTMINDED AND SEEMEDOCCUPIED NOT WITH WHAT WAS BEFORE HIS EYES BUT WITH SOMETHING SPECIAL OFHIS OWN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS FORMER AND PRESENT SELF WAS THATFORMERLY WHEN HE DID NOT GRASP WHAT LAY BEFORE HIM OR WAS SAID TO HIMHE HAD PUCKERED HIS FOREHEAD PAINFULLY AS IF VAINLY SEEKING TODISTINGUISH SOMETHING AT A DISTANCE AT PRESENT HE STILL FORGOT WHAT WASSAID TO HIM AND STILL DID NOT SEE WHAT WAS BEFORE HIS EYES BUT HE NOWLOOKED WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND SEEMINGLY IRONIC SMILE AT WHATWAS BEFORE HIM AND LISTENED TO WHAT WAS SAID THOUGH EVIDENTLY SEEINGAND HEARING SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FORMERLY HE HAD APPEARED TO BE AKINDHEARTED BUT UNHAPPY MAN AND SO PEOPLE HAD BEEN INCLINED TO AVOIDHIM NOW A SMILE AT THE JOY OF LIFE ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HIS LIPS ANDSYMPATHY FOR OTHERS SHONE IN HIS EYES WITH A QUESTIONING LOOK AS TOWHETHER THEY WERE AS CONTENTED AS HE WAS AND PEOPLE FELT PLEASED BY HISPRESENCEPREVIOUSLY HE HAD TALKED A GREAT DEAL GREW EXCITED WHEN HE TALKED ANDSELDOM LISTENED NOW HE WAS SELDOM CARRIED AWAY IN CONVERSATION AND KNEWHOW TO LISTEN SO THAT PEOPLE READILY TOLD HIM THEIR MOST INTIMATESECRETSTHE PRINCESS

HERAPPROVAL HE MERELY STUDIED HER WITH INTEREST FORMERLY SHE HAD FELTTHAT HE REGARDED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE AND IRONY AND SO HAD SHRUNK INTOHERSELF AS SHE DID WITH OTHERS AND HAD SHOWN HIM ONLY THE COMBATIVE SIDEOF HER NATURE BUT NOW HE SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MOSTINTIMATE PLACES OF HER HEART AND MISTRUSTFULLY AT FIRST BUT AFTERWARDSGRATEFULLY SHE LET HIM SEE THE HIDDEN KINDLY SIDES OF HER CHARACTERTHE MOST CUNNING MAN COULD NOT HAVE CREPT INTO HER CONFIDENCE MORESUCCESSFULLY EVOKING MEMORIES OF THE BEST TIMES OF HER YOUTH ANDSHOWING SYMPATHY WITH THEM YET PIERRES CUNNING

RUSSIATHERE IS NO ONE IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE NOW FROM SCHOOLBOY ESSAYIST TOLEARNED HISTORIAN WHO DOES NOT THROW HIS LITTLE STONE AT ALEXANDER FORTHINGS HE DID WRONG AT THIS PERIOD OF HIS REIGNHE OUGHT TO HAVE ACTED IN THIS WAY AND IN THAT WAY IN THIS CASE HE DIDWELL AND IN THAT CASE BADLY HE BEHAVED ADMIRABLY AT THE BEGINNING OFHIS REIGN AND DURING  BUT ACTED BADLY BY GIVING A CONSTITUTION TOPOLAND FORMING THE HOLY ALLIANCE ENTRUSTING POWER TO ARAKCHEEVFAVORING GOLITSYN AND MYSTICISM AND AFTERWARDS SHISHKOV AND PHOTIUS HEALSO ACTED BADLY BY CONCERNING HIMSELF WITH THE ACTIVE ARMY ANDDISBANDING THE SEMENOV REGIMENTIT WOULD TAKE A DOZEN PAGES TO ENUMERATE ALL THE REPROACHES THEHISTORIANS ADDRESS TO HIM BASED ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS GOOD FORHUMANITYWHAT DO THESE REPROACHES MEANDO NOT THE

REACTION OF  AND LATER ALSO FLOWEDIN WHAT DOES THE SUBSTANCE OF THOSE REPROACHES LIEIT LIES IN THE FACT THAT AN HISTORIC CHARACTER LIKE ALEXANDER ISTANDING ON THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PINNACLE OF HUMAN POWER WITH THEBLINDING LIGHT OF HISTORY FOCUSED UPON HIM A CHARACTER EXPOSED TO THOSESTRONGEST OF ALL INFLUENCES THE INTRIGUES FLATTERY AND SELFDECEPTIONINSEPARABLE FROM POWER A CHARACTER WHO AT EVERY MOMENT OF HIS LIFE FELTA RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND NOT AFICTITIOUS BUT A LIVE CHARACTER WHO LIKE EVERY MAN HAD HIS PERSONALHABITS PASSIONS AND IMPULSES TOWARD GOODNESS BEAUTY AND TRUTHTHATTHIS CHARACTERTHOUGH NOT LACKING IN VIRTUE THE HISTORIANS DO NOTACCUSE HIM OF THATHAD NOT THE SAME CONCEPTION OF THE WELFARE OFHUMANITY FIFTY YEARS AGO AS A PRESENTDAY PROFESSOR WHO FROM HIS YOUTHUPWARDS HAS BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LEARNING THAT IS WITH BOOKS ANDLECTURES AND WITH TAKING NOTES FROM THEMBUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT FIFTY YEARS AGO ALEXANDER I WAS MISTAKEN INHIS VIEW OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WE MUST INEVITABLY ASSUME THATTHE HISTORIAN WHO JUDGES ALEXANDER WILL ALSO AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOMETIME TURN OUT TO BE MISTAKEN IN HIS VIEW OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR HUMANITYTHIS ASSUMPTION IS ALL THE MORE NATURAL AND INEVITABLE BECAUSE WATCHINGTHE MOVEMENT OF HISTORY WE SEE THAT EVERY YEAR AND WITH EACH NEWWRITER OPINION AS TO WHAT IS GOOD FOR MANKIND CHANGES SO THAT WHATONCE SEEMED GOOD TEN YEARS LATER SEEMS BAD AND VICE VERSA AND WHAT ISMORE WE FIND AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME QUITE CONTRADICTORY VIEWS AS TOWHAT IS BAD AND WHAT IS GOOD IN HISTORY SOME PEOPLE REGARD GIVING ACONSTITUTION TO POLAND AND FORMING THE HOLY ALLIANCE AS PRAISEWORTHY INALEXANDER WHILE OTHERS REGARD IT AS BLAMEWORTHYTHE ACTIVITY OF ALEXANDER OR OF NAPOLEON CANNOT BE CALLED USEFUL ORHARMFUL FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR WHAT IT WAS USEFUL OR HARMFULIF THAT ACTIVITY DISPLEASES SOMEBODY THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOTAGREE WITH HIS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOOD WHETHER THEPRESERVATION OF MY FATHERS HOUSE IN MOSCOW OR THE GLORY OF THE RUSSIANARMS OR THE PROSPERITY OF THE PETERSBURG AND OTHER UNIVERSITIES OR THEFREEDOM OF POLAND OR THE GREATNESS OF RUSSIA OR THE BALANCE OF POWER INEUROPE OR A CERTAIN KIND OF EUROPEAN CULTURE CALLED PROGRESS APPEARTO ME TO BE GOOD OR BAD I MUST ADMIT THAT BESIDES THESE THINGS THEACTION OF EVERY HISTORIC CHARACTER HAS OTHER MORE GENERAL PURPOSESINACCESSIBLE TO MEBUT LET US ASSUME THAT WHAT IS CALLED SCIENCE CAN HARMONIZE ALLCONTRADICTIONS AND POSSESSES AN UNCHANGING STANDARD OF GOOD AND BAD BYWHICH TO TRY HISTORIC CHARACTERS AND EVENTS LET US SAY THAT ALEXANDERCOULD HAVE DONE EVERYTHING DIFFERENTLY LET US SAY THAT WITH GUIDANCEFROM THOSE WHO BLAME HIM AND WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THEMOVEMENT OF HUMANITY HE MIGHT HAVE ARRANGED MATTERS ACCORDING TO THEPROGRAM HIS PRESENT ACCUSERS WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIMOF NATIONALITYFREEDOM EQUALITY AND PROGRESS THESE I THINK COVER THE GROUND LETUS ASSUME THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS POSSIBLE AND HAD THEN BEEN FORMULATEDAND THAT ALEXANDER HAD ACTED ON IT WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BECOME OF THEACTIVITY OF ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE TENDENCY THAT THEN PREVAILED INTHE GOVERNMENTAN ACTIVITY THAT IN THE OPINION OF THE HISTORIANS WASGOOD AND BENEFICENT THEIR ACTIVITY WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED THERE WOULDHAVE BEEN NO LIFE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHINGIF WE ADMIT THAT

OF FRANCE THEBALANCE OF POWER IN EUROPE THE DIFFUSION OF THE IDEAS OF THEREVOLUTION GENERAL PROGRESS OR ANYTHING ELSETHEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TOEXPLAIN THE FACTS OF HISTORY WITHOUT INTRODUCING THE

PRECEDING WARS AND WITHOUT THE INVASION IFTHE AIM WAS THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF FRANCE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTAINEDWITHOUT THE REVOLUTION AND WITHOUT THE EMPIRE IF THE AIM WAS THEDISSEMINATION OF IDEAS THE PRINTING PRESS COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THATMUCH BETTER THAN WARFARE IF THE AIM WAS THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATIONIT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF DIFFUSING CIVILIZATIONMORE EXPEDIENT

MOVEMENTS FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST AND FROMTHE EAST TO THE WEST FORM THE ESSENCE AND PURPOSE OF THESE EVENTS ANDNOT ONLY SHALL WE HAVE NO NEED TO SEE EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AND GENIUS INNAPOLEON AND

COULD BE SATISFIED ONLY BY RENOUNCINGSOCIETY ALL WHO HAD KNOWN NATASHA BEFORE HER MARRIAGE WONDERED AT THECHANGE IN HER AS AT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY ONLY THE OLD COUNTESS WITHHER MATERNAL INSTINCT HAD REALIZED THAT ALL NATASHAS OUTBURSTS HAD BEENDUE TO HER NEED OF CHILDREN AND A HUSBANDAS SHE HERSELF HAD ONCEEXCLAIMED AT OTRADNOE NOT SO MUCH IN FUN AS IN EARNESTAND HER MOTHERWAS NOW SURPRISED AT THE SURPRISE EXPRESSED BY THOSE WHO HAD NEVERUNDERSTOOD NATASHA AND SHE KEPT SAYING THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THATNATASHA WOULD MAKE AN EXEMPLARY WIFE AND MOTHERONLY SHE LETS HER LOVE OF HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN OVERFLOW ALLBOUNDS SAID THE COUNTESS SO THAT IT EVEN BECOMES ABSURDNATASHA DID NOT FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE ADVOCATED BY CLEVER FOLKESPECIALLY BY THE FRENCH WHICH SAYS THAT A GIRL SHOULD NOT LET HERSELFGO WHEN SHE MARRIES SHOULD NOT NEGLECT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHOULD BEEVEN MORE CAREFUL OF HER APPEARANCE THAN WHEN SHE WAS UNMARRIED ANDSHOULD FASCINATE HER HUSBAND AS MUCH AS SHE DID BEFORE HE BECAME HERHUSBAND NATASHA ON THE CONTRARY HAD AT ONCE ABANDONED ALL HER WITCHERYOF WHICH HER SINGING HAD BEEN AN UNUSUALLY POWERFUL PART SHE GAVE IT UPJUST BECAUSE IT WAS SO POWERFULLY SEDUCTIVE SHE TOOK NO PAINS WITH HERMANNERS OR WITH DELICACY OF SPEECH OR WITH HER TOILET OR TO SHOWHERSELF TO HER HUSBAND IN HER MOST BECOMING ATTITUDES OR TO AVOIDINCONVENIENCING HIM BY BEING TOO EXACTING SHE ACTED IN CONTRADICTION TOALL THOSE RULES SHE FELT THAT THE ALLUREMENTS INSTINCT HAD FORMERLYTAUGHT HER TO USE WOULD NOW BE MERELY RIDICULOUS IN THE EYES OF HERHUSBAND TO WHOM SHE HAD FROM THE FIRST MOMENT GIVEN HERSELF UPENTIRELYTHAT IS WITH HER WHOLE SOUL LEAVING NO CORNER OF IT HIDDENFROM HIM SHE FELT THAT HER UNITY WITH HER HUSBAND WAS NOT MAINTAINED BYTHE POETIC FEELINGS THAT HAD ATTRACTED HIM TO HER BUT BY SOMETHINGELSEINDEFINITE BUT FIRM AS THE BOND BETWEEN HER OWN BODY AND SOULTO FLUFF OUT HER CURLS PUT ON FASHIONABLE DRESSES AND SING ROMANTICSONGS TO FASCINATE HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE SEEMED AS STRANGE AS TO ADORNHERSELF TO ATTRACT HERSELF TO ADORN HERSELF FOR OTHERS MIGHT PERHAPSHAVE BEEN AGREEABLESHE DID NOT KNOWBUT SHE HAD NO TIME AT ALL FORIT THE CHIEF REASON FOR DEVOTING NO TIME EITHER TO SINGING TO DRESSOR TO CHOOSING HER WORDS WAS THAT SHE REALLY HAD NO TIME TO SPARE FORTHESE THINGSWE KNOW THAT MAN HAS THE FACULTY OF BECOMING COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN ASUBJECT HOWEVER TRIVIAL IT MAY BE AND THAT THERE IS NO SUBJECT SOTRIVIAL THAT IT WILL NOT GROW TO INFINITE PROPORTIONS IF ONES ENTIREATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO ITTHE SUBJECT WHICH WHOLLY ENGROSSED NATASHAS ATTENTION WAS HER FAMILYTHAT IS HER HUSBAND WHOM SHE HAD TO KEEP SO THAT HE SHOULD BELONGENTIRELY TO HER AND TO THE HOME AND THE CHILDREN WHOM SHE HAD TO BEARBRING INTO THE WORLD NURSE AND BRING UPAND THE DEEPER SHE PENETRATED NOT WITH HER MIND ONLY BUT WITH HER WHOLESOUL HER WHOLE BEING INTO THE SUBJECT THAT ABSORBED HER THE LARGERDID THAT SUBJECT GROW AND THE WEAKER AND MORE INADEQUATE DID HER POWERSAPPEAR SO THAT SHE CONCENTRATED THEM WHOLLY ON THAT ONE THING AND YETWAS UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THAT SHE CONSIDERED NECESSARYTHERE WERE THEN AS NOW CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WOMENSRIGHTS THE RELATIONS OF HUSBAND AND WIFE AND THEIR FREEDOM AND RIGHTSTHOUGH THESE THEMES WERE NOT YET TERMED QUESTIONS AS THEY ARE NOW BUTTHESE TOPICS WERE NOT MERELY UNINTERESTING TO NATASHA SHE POSITIVELYDID NOT UNDERSTAND THEMTHESE QUESTIONS THEN AS NOW EXISTED ONLY FOR THOSE WHO SEE NOTHING INMARRIAGE BUT THE PLEASURE MARRIED PEOPLE GET FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT ISONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF MARRIAGE AND NOT ITS WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE WHICHLIES IN THE FAMILYDISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS OF THAT KIND WHICH ARE LIKE THE QUESTION OFHOW TO GET THE GREATEST GRATIFICATION FROM ONES DINNER DID NOT THENAND DO NOT NOW EXIST FOR THOSE FOR WHOM THE PURPOSE OF A DINNER IS THENOURISHMENT IT AFFORDS AND THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE FAMILYIF THE PURPOSE OF DINNER IS TO NOURISH THE BODY A MAN WHO EATS TWODINNERS AT ONCE MAY PERHAPS GET MORE ENJOYMENT BUT WILL NOT ATTAIN HISPURPOSE FOR HIS STOMACH WILL NOT DIGEST THE TWO DINNERSIF THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE FAMILY THE PERSON WHO WISHES TO HAVEMANY WIVES OR HUSBANDS MAY PERHAPS OBTAIN MUCH PLEASURE BUT IN THATCASE WILL NOT HAVE A FAMILYIF THE PURPOSE OF FOOD IS NOURISHMENT AND THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THEFAMILY THE WHOLE QUESTION RESOLVES ITSELF INTO NOT EATING MORE THAN ONECAN DIGEST AND NOT HAVING MORE WIVES OR HUSBANDS THAN ARE NEEDED FORTHE FAMILYTHAT IS ONE WIFE OR ONE HUSBAND NATASHA NEEDED A HUSBANDA HUSBAND WAS GIVEN HER AND HE GAVE HER A FAMILY AND SHE NOT ONLY SAWNO NEED OF ANY OTHER OR BETTER HUSBAND BUT AS ALL THE POWERS OF HERSOUL WERE INTENT ON SERVING THAT HUSBAND AND FAMILY SHE COULD NOTIMAGINE AND SAW NO

MEETING THE QUESTIONS WHICH ALL THEHISTORIANS GIVE FROM THE COMPILERS OF MEMOIRS AND THE HISTORIES OFSEPARATE STATES TO THE WRITERS OF GENERAL HISTORIES AND THE NEWHISTORIES OF THE CULTURE OF THAT PERIODTHE STRANGENESS AND ABSURDITY OF THESE REPLIES ARISE FROM THE FACT THATMODERN HISTORY LIKE A DEAF MAN ANSWERS QUESTIONS NO ONE HAS ASKEDIF THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY BE TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OFHUMANITY AND OF THE PEOPLES THE FIRST QUESTIONIN THE ABSENCE OF AREPLY TO WHICH ALL THE REST WILL BE INCOMPREHENSIBLEIS WHAT IS THEPOWER THAT MOVES PEOPLES TO THIS MODERN HISTORY LABORIOUSLY REPLIESEITHER THAT NAPOLEON WAS A GREAT GENIUS OR THAT LOUIS XIV WAS VERYPROUD OR THAT CERTAIN WRITERS WROTE CERTAIN BOOKSALL THAT MAY BE SO AND MANKIND IS READY TO AGREE WITH IT BUT IT IS NOTWHAT WAS ASKED ALL THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF WE RECOGNIZED A DIVINEPOWER BASED ON ITSELF AND ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY DIRECTING ITS NATIONSTHROUGH NAPOLEONS LOUISES AND WRITERS BUT WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE SUCHA POWER AND THEREFORE BEFORE SPEAKING ABOUT NAPOLEONS LOUISES ANDAUTHORS WE OUGHT TO BE SHOWN THE CONNECTION EXISTING BETWEEN THESE MENAND THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONSIF INSTEAD OF A

MANY FORCES CAN NO LONGER IT WOULD SEEM BE REGARDEDAS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS YET IN MOST CASES UNIVERSALHISTORIANS STILL EMPLOY THE CONCEPTION OF POWER AS A FORCE THAT ITSELFPRODUCES

HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS JUST AS SUCH ACONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCEHANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE BUT WHY INTELLECTUALACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED BY THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE TO BE THE CAUSE OREXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND ONLYTHE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HAVE LED THE HISTORIANS TO SUCH ACONCLUSION  THAT

DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TOWARD A CERTAIN ENDAND THE ONLY SUCH CONCEPTION KNOWN TO HISTORIANS IS THAT OF POWERTHIS CONCEPTION IS THE ONE HANDLE BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MATERIAL OFHISTORY AS AT PRESENT EXPOUNDED CAN BE DEALT WITH AND ANYONE WHOBREAKS THAT HANDLE OFF AS BUCKLE DID WITHOUT FINDING SOME OTHER METHODOF TREATING HISTORICAL MATERIAL MERELY DEPRIVES HIMSELF OF THE ONEPOSSIBLE WAY OF DEALING WITH IT THE NECESSITY OF THE CONCEPTION OFPOWER AS AN EXPLANATION OF HISTORICAL EVENTS IS BEST DEMONSTRATED BY THEUNIVERSAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF CULTURE THEMSELVES FOR THEYPROFESSEDLY

TODETERMINE WHAT IS THIS POWER OF ONE MAN OVER OTHERSIT CANNOT BE THE DIRECT PHYSICAL POWER OF A STRONG MAN OVER A WEAK ONEA DOMINATION BASED ON THE APPLICATION OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL FORCE LIKETHE POWER OF HERCULES NOR CAN IT BE BASED ON THE EFFECT OF MORAL FORCEAS IN THEIR SIMPLICITY SOME HISTORIANS THINK WHO SAY THAT THE LEADINGFIGURES IN HISTORY ARE HEROES THAT IS MEN GIFTED WITH A SPECIALSTRENGTH OF SOUL AND MIND CALLED GENIUS THIS POWER CANNOT BE BASED ONTHE PREDOMINANCE OF MORAL STRENGTH FOR NOT TO MENTION HEROES SUCH ASNAPOLEON ABOUT WHOSE MORAL QUALITIES OPINIONS DIFFER WIDELY HISTORYSHOWS US THAT NEITHER A LOUIS XI NOR A METTERNICH WHO RULED OVERMILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAD ANY PARTICULAR MORAL QUALITIES BUT ON THECONTRARY WERE GENERALLY MORALLY WEAKER THAN ANY OF THE MILLIONS THEYRULED OVERIF THE SOURCE OF POWER LIES NEITHER IN THE PHYSICAL NOR IN THE MORALQUALITIES OF HIM WHO POSSESSES IT IT MUST EVIDENTLY BE LOOKED FORELSEWHEREIN THE RELATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE MAN WHO WIELDS THEPOWERAND THAT IS HOW POWER IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCETHAT EXCHANGE BANK OF HISTORY WHICH OFFERS TO EXCHANGE HISTORYSUNDERSTANDING OF POWER FOR TRUE GOLDPOWER IS THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED BY EXPRESSED ORTACIT CONSENT TO THEIR CHOSEN RULERSIN THE DOMAIN OF JURISPRUDENCE WHICH CONSISTS OF DISCUSSIONS OF HOW ASTATE AND POWER MIGHT BE ARRANGED WERE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL THAT TO BEARRANGED IT IS ALL VERY CLEAR BUT WHEN APPLIED TO HISTORY THATDEFINITION OF POWER NEEDS EXPLANATIONTHE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE REGARDS THE STATE AND POWER AS THE ANCIENTSREGARDED FIRENAMELY AS SOMETHING EXISTING ABSOLUTELY BUT FORHISTORY THE STATE AND POWER ARE MERELY PHENOMENA JUST AS FOR MODERNPHYSICS FIRE IS NOT AN ELEMENT BUT A PHENOMENONFROM THIS FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VIEW HELD BY HISTORY ANDTHAT HELD BY JURISPRUDENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT JURISPRUDENCE CAN TELLMINUTELY HOW IN ITS OPINION POWER SHOULD BE CONSTITUTED AND WHAT

ALSO TRANSFERRED TO THEIRCONQUEROR WAS THE WILL OF THE CONFEDERATION OF THE RHINE TRANSFERRED TONAPOLEON IN  WAS THE WILL OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE TRANSFERRED TONAPOLEON IN  WHEN OUR ARMY IN ALLIANCE WITH THE FRENCH WENT TOFIGHT THE AUSTRIANSTO THESE QUESTIONS THREE ANSWERS ARE POSSIBLEEITHER TO ASSUME  THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS ALWAYSUNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE RULER OR RULERS THEY HAVE CHOSEN ANDTHAT THEREFORE EVERY EMERGENCE OF A NEW POWER EVERY STRUGGLE AGAINSTTHE POWER ONCE APPOINTED SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY REGARDED AS ANINFRINGEMENT OF THE REAL POWER OR  THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ISTRANSFERRED TO THE RULERS CONDITIONALLY UNDER DEFINITE AND KNOWNCONDITIONS AND TO SHOW THAT ALL LIMITATIONS CONFLICTS AND EVENDESTRUCTIONS OF POWER RESULT FROM A NONOBSERVANCE BY THE RULERS OF THECONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEIR POWER WAS ENTRUSTED TO THEM OR  THATTHE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS DELEGATED TO THE RULERS CONDITIONALLY BUTTHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN AND INDEFINITE AND THAT THE APPEARANCEOF SEVERAL AUTHORITIES THEIR STRUGGLES AND THEIR FALLS RESULT SOLELYFROM THE GREATER OR LESSER FULFILLMENT BY THE RULERS OF THESE UNKNOWNCONDITIONS ON WHICH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS TRANSFERRED FROM SOMEPEOPLE TO OTHERSAND THESE ARE THE THREE WAYS IN WHICH THE HISTORIANS DO EXPLAIN THERELATION OF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR RULERSSOME HISTORIANSTHOSE BIOGRAPHICAL AND SPECIALIST HISTORIANS ALREADYREFERRED TOIN THEIR SIMPLICITY FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION OFTHE MEANING OF POWER SEEM TO CONSIDER THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THEPEOPLE IS UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED TO HISTORICAL PERSONS ANDTHEREFORE WHEN DESCRIBING SOME SINGLE STATE THEY ASSUME THAT PARTICULARPOWER TO BE THE ONE ABSOLUTE AND REAL POWER AND THAT ANY OTHER FORCEOPPOSING THIS IS NOT A POWER BUT A VIOLATION OF POWERMERE VIOLENCETHEIR THEORY SUITABLE FOR PRIMITIVE AND PEACEFUL PERIODS OF HISTORYHAS THE INCONVENIENCEIN APPLICATION TO COMPLEX AND STORMY PERIODS INTHE LIFE OF NATIONS DURING WHICH VARIOUS POWERS ARISE SIMULTANEOUSLY ANDSTRUGGLE WITH ONE ANOTHERTHAT A LEGITIMIST HISTORIAN WILL PROVE THATTHE NATIONAL CONVENTION THE DIRECTORY AND BONAPARTE WERE MEREINFRINGERS OF THE TRUE POWER WHILE A REPUBLICAN AND A BONAPARTIST WILLPROVE THE ONE THAT THE CONVENTION AND THE OTHER THAT THE EMPIRE WAS THEREAL POWER AND THAT ALL THE OTHERS WERE VIOLATIONS OF POWER EVIDENTLYTHE EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY THESE HISTORIANS BEING MUTUALLYCONTRADICTORY CAN ONLY SATISFY YOUNG CHILDRENRECOGNIZING THE FALSITY OF THIS VIEW OF HISTORY ANOTHER SET OFHISTORIANS SAY THAT POWER RESTS ON A CONDITIONAL DELEGATION OF THE WILLOF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR RULERS AND THAT HISTORICAL LEADERS HAVE POWERONLY CONDITIONALLY ON CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM THAT THE WILL OF THEPEOPLE HAS BY TACIT AGREEMENT PRESCRIBED TO THEM BUT WHAT THIS PROGRAMCONSISTS IN THESE HISTORIANS DO NOT SAY OR IF THEY DO THEY CONTINUALLYCONTRADICT ONE ANOTHEREACH HISTORIAN ACCORDING TO HIS VIEW OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A NATIONSPROGRESS LOOKS FOR THESE CONDITIONS IN THE GREATNESS WEALTH FREEDOMOR ENLIGHTENMENT OF CITIZENS OF FRANCE OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY BUT NOT TOMENTION THE HISTORIANS CONTRADICTIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS PROGRAMOR EVEN ADMITTING THAT SOME ONE GENERAL PROGRAM OF THESE CONDITIONSEXISTSTHE FACTS OF HISTORY ALMOST ALWAYS CONTRADICT THAT THEORY IFTHE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH POWER IS ENTRUSTED CONSIST IN THE WEALTHFREEDOM AND ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE PEOPLE HOW IS IT THAT LOUIS XIV ANDIVAN THE TERRIBLE END THEIR REIGNS TRANQUILLY WHILE LOUIS XVI ANDCHARLES I ARE EXECUTED BY THEIR PEOPLE TO THIS QUESTION HISTORIANSREPLY THAT LOUIS XIVS ACTIVITY CONTRARY TO THE PROGRAM REACTED ONLOUIS XVI BUT WHY DID IT NOT REACT ON LOUIS XIV OR ON LOUIS XVWHYSHOULD IT REACT JUST ON LOUIS XVI AND WHAT IS THE TIME LIMIT FOR SUCHREACTIONS TO THESE QUESTIONS THERE ARE AND CAN BE NO ANSWERS EQUALLYLITTLE DOES THIS VIEW EXPLAIN WHY FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES THE COLLECTIVEWILL IS NOT WITHDRAWN FROM CERTAIN RULERS AND THEIR HEIRS AND THENSUDDENLY DURING A PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS IS TRANSFERRED TO THECONVENTION TO THE DIRECTORY TO NAPOLEON TO ALEXANDER TO LOUIS XVIIITO NAPOLEON AGAIN TO CHARLES X TO LOUIS PHILIPPE TO A REPUBLICANGOVERNMENT AND TO NAPOLEON III WHEN EXPLAINING THESE RAPID TRANSFERSOF THE PEOPLES WILL FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER ESPECIALLY IN VIEWOF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CONQUESTS AND ALLIANCES THE HISTORIANS AREOBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT SOME OF THESE TRANSFERS ARE NOT NORMAL DELEGATIONSOF THE PEOPLES WILL BUT ARE ACCIDENTS DEPENDENT ON CUNNING ONMISTAKES ON CRAFT OR ON THE WEAKNESS OF A DIPLOMATIST A RULER OR APARTY LEADER SO THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE EVENTS OF HISTORYCIVILWARS REVOLUTIONS AND CONQUESTSARE PRESENTED BY THESE HISTORIANS NOTAS THE RESULTS OF FREE TRANSFERENCES OF THE PEOPLES WILL BUT ASRESULTS OF THE ILLDIRECTED WILL OF ONE OR MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT ISONCE AGAIN AS USURPATIONS OF POWER AND SO THESE HISTORIANS ALSO SEEAND ADMIT HISTORICAL EVENTS WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE THEORYTHESE HISTORIANS RESEMBLE A BOTANIST WHO HAVING NOTICED THAT SOMEPLANTS GROW FROM SEEDS PRODUCING TWO COTYLEDONS SHOULD INSIST THAT ALLTHAT GROWS DOES SO BY SPROUTING INTO TWO LEAVES AND THAT THE PALM THEMUSHROOM AND EVEN THE OAK WHICH BLOSSOM INTO FULL GROWTH AND NO LONGERRESEMBLE TWO LEAVES ARE DEVIATIONS FROM THE THEORYHISTORIANS OF THE THIRD CLASS ASSUME THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ISTRANSFERRED TO HISTORIC PERSONAGES CONDITIONALLY BUT THAT THECONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN TO US THEY SAY THAT HISTORICAL PERSONAGES HAVEPOWER ONLY BECAUSE THEY FULFILL THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WHICH HAS BEENDELEGATED TO THEMBUT IN THAT CASE IF THE FORCE THAT MOVES NATIONS LIES NOT IN THEHISTORIC LEADERS BUT IN THE NATIONS THEMSELVES WHAT SIGNIFICANCE HAVETHOSE LEADERSTHE LEADERS THESE HISTORIANS TELL US EXPRESS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLETHE ACTIVITY OF THE LEADERS REPRESENTS THE ACTIVITY OF THE PEOPLEBUT IN THAT CASE THE QUESTION ARISES WHETHER ALL THE ACTIVITY OF THELEADERS SERVES AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PEOPLES WILL OR ONLY SOME PARTOF IT IF THE WHOLE ACTIVITY OF THE LEADERS SERVES AS THE EXPRESSION OFTHE PEOPLES WILL AS SOME HISTORIANS SUPPOSE THEN ALL THE DETAILS OFTHE COURT SCANDALS CONTAINED IN THE BIOGRAPHIES OF A NAPOLEON OR ACATHERINE SERVE TO EXPRESS THE LIFE OF THE NATION WHICH IS EVIDENTNONSENSE BUT IF IT IS ONLY SOME PARTICULAR SIDE OF THE ACTIVITY OF ANHISTORICAL LEADER WHICH SERVES TO EXPRESS THE PEOPLES LIFE AS OTHERSOCALLED PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORIANS BELIEVE THEN TO DETERMINE WHICHSIDE OF THE ACTIVITY OF A LEADER EXPRESSES THE NATIONS LIFE WE HAVEFIRST OF ALL TO KNOW IN WHAT THE NATIONS LIFE CONSISTSMET BY THIS DIFFICULTY HISTORIANS OF THAT CLASS DEVISE SOME MOSTOBSCURE IMPALPABLE AND GENERAL ABSTRACTION WHICH CAN COVER ALLCONCEIVABLE

VESTED IN THATLEADER THIS IS WHAT HISTORIANS OF THE FIRST CLASS SAYTHOSE WHOASSUME THE UNCONDITIONAL TRANSFERENCE OF THE PEOPLES WILLIF THE ANIMALS LEADING THE HERD CHANGE THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THECOLLECTIVE WILL OF ALL THE ANIMALS IS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE LEADER TOANOTHER ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE ANIMAL IS OR IS NOT LEADING THEM INTHE DIRECTION SELECTED BY THE WHOLE HERD SUCH IS THE REPLY HISTORIANSWHO ASSUME THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS DELEGATED TO RULERSUNDER CONDITIONS WHICH THEY REGARD AS KNOWN WITH THIS METHOD OFOBSERVATION IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT THE OBSERVER INFLUENCED BY THEDIRECTION HE HIMSELF PREFERS REGARDS THOSE AS LEADERS WHO OWING TO THEPEOPLES CHANGE OF DIRECTION ARE NO LONGER IN FRONT BUT ON ONE SIDEOR EVEN IN THE REARIF THE ANIMALS IN FRONT ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING AND THE DIRECTION OFTHE WHOLE HERD IS CONSTANTLY ALTERED THIS IS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FOLLOWA GIVEN DIRECTION THE ANIMALS TRANSFER THEIR WILL TO THE ANIMALS THATHAVE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION AND TO STUDY THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HERD WEMUST WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL THE PROMINENT ANIMALS MOVING ON ALLSIDES OF THE HERD SO SAY THE THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS WHO REGARD ALLHISTORICAL PERSONS FROM MONARCHS TO JOURNALISTS AS THE EXPRESSION OFTHEIR AGETHE THEORY OF THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO HISTORICPERSONS IS MERELY A PARAPHRASEA RESTATEMENT OF THE QUESTION IN OTHERWORDSWHAT CAUSES HISTORICAL EVENTS POWER WHAT IS POWER POWER IS THECOLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED TO ONE PERSON UNDER WHATCONDITION IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE DELEGATED TO ONE PERSON ONCONDITION THAT THAT PERSON EXPRESSES THE WILL OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE THATIS POWER IS POWER IN OTHER WORDS POWER IS A WORD THE MEANING OF WHICHWE DO NOT UNDERSTANDIF THE REALM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE WERE CONFINED TO ABSTRACT REASONINGTHEN HAVING SUBJECTED TO CRITICISM THE EXPLANATION OF POWER THATJURIDICAL SCIENCE GIVES US HUMANITY WOULD CONCLUDE THAT POWER IS MERELYA WORD AND HAS NO REAL EXISTENCE BUT TO UNDERSTAND PHENOMENA MAN HASBESIDES ABSTRACT REASONING EXPERIENCE BY WHICH HE VERIFIES HISREFLECTIONS AND EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT POWER IS NOT MERELY A WORD BUTAN ACTUALLY EXISTING PHENOMENONNOT TO SPEAK OF THE FACT THAT NO DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLECTIVE ACTIVITYOF MEN CAN DO WITHOUT THE CONCEPTION OF POWER THE EXISTENCE OF POWER ISPROVED BOTH BY HISTORY AND BY OBSERVING CONTEMPORARY EVENTSWHENEVER AN EVENT OCCURS A MAN APPEARS OR MEN APPEAR BY WHOSE WILL THEEVENT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE NAPOLEON III ISSUES A DECREE AND THEFRENCH GO TO MEXICO THE KING OF PRUSSIA AND BISMARCK ISSUE DECREES ANDAN ARMY ENTERS BOHEMIA NAPOLEON I ISSUES A DECREE AND AN ARMY ENTERSRUSSIA ALEXANDER I GIVES A COMMAND AND THE FRENCH SUBMIT TO THEBOURBONS EXPERIENCE SHOWS US THAT WHATEVER EVENT OCCURS IT IS ALWAYSRELATED TO THE WILL OF ONE OR OF SEVERAL MEN WHO HAVE DECREED ITTHE HISTORIANS IN ACCORD WITH THE OLD HABIT OF ACKNOWLEDGING DIVINEINTERVENTION IN HUMAN AFFAIRS WANT TO SEE THE CAUSE OF EVENTS IN THEEXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF SOMEONE ENDOWED WITH POWER BUT THATSUPPOSITION IS NOT CONFIRMED EITHER BY REASON OR BY EXPERIENCEON THE ONE SIDE REFLECTION SHOWS THAT THE EXPRESSION OF A MANS WILLHIS WORDSARE ONLY PART OF THE GENERAL ACTIVITY EXPRESSED IN AN EVENTAS FOR INSTANCE IN A WAR OR A REVOLUTION AND SO WITHOUT ASSUMING ANINCOMPREHENSIBLE SUPERNATURAL FORCEA MIRACLEONE CANNOT ADMIT THATWORDS CAN BE THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF MILLIONS OF MEN ONTHE OTHER HAND EVEN IF WE ADMITTED THAT WORDS COULD BE THE CAUSE OFEVENTS HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF HISTORICALPERSONAGES DOES NOT IN MOST CASES PRODUCE ANY EFFECT THAT IS TO SAYTHEIR COMMANDS ARE OFTEN NOT EXECUTED AND SOMETIMES THE VERY OPPOSITEOF WHAT THEY ORDER OCCURSWITHOUT ADMITTING DIVINE INTERVENTION IN THE AFFAIRS OF HUMANITY WECANNOT REGARD POWER AS THE CAUSE OF EVENTSPOWER FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EXPERIENCE IS MERELY THE RELATION THATEXISTS BETWEEN THE EXPRESSION OF SOMEONES WILL AND THE EXECUTION OFTHAT WILL BY OTHERSTO EXPLAIN THE CONDITIONS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP WE MUST FIRST ESTABLISH ACONCEPTION OF THE EXPRESSION OF WILL REFERRING IT TO MAN AND NOT TO THEDEITYIF THE DEITY ISSUES A COMMAND EXPRESSES HIS WILL AS ANCIENT HISTORYTELLS US THE EXPRESSION OF THAT WILL IS INDEPENDENT OF TIME AND IS NOTCAUSED BY ANYTHING FOR THE DIVINITY IS NOT CONTROLLED BY AN EVENT BUTSPEAKING OF COMMANDS THAT ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF MEN ACTINGIN TIME AND IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION OFCOMMANDS WITH EVENTS WE MUST RESTORE  THE CONDITION OF ALL THATTAKES PLACE THE CONTINUITY OF MOVEMENT IN TIME BOTH OF THE EVENTS ANDOF THE PERSON WHO COMMANDS AND  THE INEVITABILITY OF THE CONNECTIONBETWEEN THE PERSON COMMANDING AND THOSE WHO EXECUTE HIS COMMANDCHAPTER VIONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE DEITY NOT DEPENDENT ON TIME CANRELATE TO A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS OCCURRING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS ORCENTURIES AND ONLY THE DEITY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYTHING CAN BY HISSOLE WILL DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF HUMANITYS MOVEMENT BUT MAN ACTSIN TIME AND HIMSELF TAKES PART IN WHAT OCCURSREINSTATING THE FIRST CONDITION OMITTED THAT OF TIME WE SEE THAT NOCOMMAND CAN BE EXECUTED WITHOUT SOME PRECEDING ORDER HAVING BEEN GIVENRENDERING THE EXECUTION OF THE LAST COMMAND POSSIBLENO COMMAND EVER APPEARS SPONTANEOUSLY OR ITSELF COVERS A WHOLE SERIESOF OCCURRENCES BUT EACH COMMAND FOLLOWS FROM ANOTHER AND NEVER REFERSTO A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS BUT ALWAYS TO ONE MOMENT ONLY OF AN EVENTWHEN FOR INSTANCE WE SAY THAT NAPOLEON ORDERED ARMIES TO GO TO WAR WECOMBINE IN ONE SIMULTANEOUS EXPRESSION A WHOLE SERIES OF CONSECUTIVECOMMANDS DEPENDENT ONE ON ANOTHER NAPOLEON COULD NOT HAVE COMMANDED ANINVASION OF RUSSIA AND NEVER DID SO TODAY HE ORDERED SUCH AND SUCHPAPERS TO BE WRITTEN TO VIENNA TO BERLIN AND TO PETERSBURG TOMORROWSUCH AND SUCH DECREES AND ORDERS TO THE ARMY THE FLEET THECOMMISSARIAT AND SO ON AND SO ONMILLIONS OF COMMANDS WHICH FORMED AWHOLE SERIES CORRESPONDING TO A SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH BROUGHT THEFRENCH ARMIES INTO RUSSIAIF THROUGHOUT HIS REIGN NAPOLEON GAVE COMMANDS CONCERNING AN INVASION OFENGLAND AND EXPENDED ON NO OTHER UNDERTAKING SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORTAND YET DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN NEVER ONCE ATTEMPTED TO EXECUTE THATDESIGN BUT UNDERTOOK AN EXPEDITION INTO RUSSIA WITH WHICH COUNTRY HECONSIDERED IT DESIRABLE TO BE IN ALLIANCE A CONVICTION HE REPEATEDLYEXPRESSEDTHIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE HIS COMMANDS DID NOT CORRESPOND TOTHE COURSE OF EVENTS IN THE FIRST CASE BUT DID SO CORRESPOND IN THELATTERFOR AN ORDER TO BE CERTAINLY EXECUTED IT IS NECESSARY THAT A MAN SHOULDORDER WHAT CAN BE EXECUTED BUT TO KNOW WHAT CAN AND WHAT CANNOT BEEXECUTED IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONLY IN THE CASE OF NAPOLEONS INVASION OFRUSSIA IN WHICH MILLIONS PARTICIPATED BUT EVEN IN THE SIMPLEST EVENTFOR IN EITHER CASE MILLIONS OF OBSTACLES MAY ARISE TO PREVENT ITSEXECUTION EVERY ORDER EXECUTED IS ALWAYS ONE OF AN IMMENSE NUMBERUNEXECUTED ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE ORDERS INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURSE OFEVENTS REMAIN UNEXECUTED ONLY THE POSSIBLE ONES GET LINKED UP WITH ACONSECUTIVE SERIES OF COMMANDS CORRESPONDING TO A SERIES OF EVENTS ANDARE EXECUTEDOUR FALSE CONCEPTION THAT AN EVENT IS CAUSED BY A COMMAND WHICH PRECEDESIT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THE EVENT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND OUT OFTHOUSANDS OF OTHERS THOSE FEW COMMANDS WHICH WERE CONSISTENT WITH THATEVENT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED WE FORGET ABOUT THE OTHERS THAT WERE NOTEXECUTED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BE APART FROM THAT THE CHIEF SOURCE OFOUR ERROR IN THIS MATTER IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN THE HISTORICALACCOUNTS A WHOLE SERIES OF INNUMERABLE DIVERSE AND PETTY EVENTS SUCHFOR INSTANCE AS ALL THOSE WHICH LED THE FRENCH ARMIES TO RUSSIA ISGENERALIZED INTO ONE EVENT IN ACCORD WITH THE RESULT PRODUCED BY THATSERIES OF EVENTS AND CORRESPONDING WITH THIS GENERALIZATION THE WHOLESERIES OF COMMANDS IS ALSO GENERALIZED INTO A SINGLE EXPRESSION OF WILLWE SAY THAT NAPOLEON WISHED TO INVADE RUSSIA AND INVADED IT IN REALITYIN ALL NAPOLEONS ACTIVITY WE NEVER FIND ANYTHING RESEMBLING ANEXPRESSION OF THAT WISH BUT FIND A SERIES OF ORDERS OR EXPRESSIONS OFHIS WILL VERY VARIOUSLY AND INDEFINITELY DIRECTED AMID A LONG SERIESOF UNEXECUTED ORDERS OF NAPOLEONS ONE SERIES FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF WAS CARRIED OUTNOT BECAUSE THOSE ORDERS DIFFERED IN ANY WAY FROM THEOTHER UNEXECUTED ORDERS BUT BECAUSE THEY COINCIDED WITH THE COURSE OFEVENTS THAT LED THE FRENCH ARMY INTO RUSSIA JUST AS IN STENCIL WORKTHIS OR THAT FIGURE COMES OUT NOT BECAUSE THE COLOR WAS LAID ON FROMTHIS SIDE OR IN THAT WAY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS LAID ON FROM ALL SIDES OVERTHE FIGURE CUT IN THE STENCILSO THAT EXAMINING THE RELATION IN TIME OF THE COMMANDS TO THE EVENTS WEFIND THAT A COMMAND CAN NEVER BE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT BUT THAT ACERTAIN DEFINITE DEPENDENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWOTO UNDERSTAND IN WHAT THIS DEPENDENCE CONSISTS IT IS NECESSARY TOREINSTATE ANOTHER OMITTED CONDITION OF EVERY COMMAND PROCEEDING NOT FROMTHE DEITY BUT FROM A MAN WHICH IS THAT THE MAN WHO GIVES THE COMMANDHIMSELF TAKES PART IN THE EVENTTHIS RELATION OF THE COMMANDER TO THOSE HE COMMANDS IS JUST WHAT ISCALLED POWER THIS RELATION CONSISTS IN THE FOLLOWINGFOR COMMON ACTION PEOPLE ALWAYS UNITE IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS IN WHICHREGARDLESS OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE AIMS SET FOR THE COMMON ACTION THERELATION BETWEEN THOSE TAKING PART IN IT IS ALWAYS THE SAMEMEN UNITING IN THESE COMBINATIONS ALWAYS ASSUME SUCH RELATIONS TOWARDONE ANOTHER THAT THE LARGER NUMBER TAKE A MORE DIRECT SHARE AND THESMALLER NUMBER A LESS DIRECT SHARE IN THE COLLECTIVE ACTION FOR WHICHTHEY HAVE COMBINEDOF ALL THE COMBINATIONS IN WHICH MEN UNITE FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION ONE OFTHE MOST STRIKING AND DEFINITE EXAMPLES IS AN ARMYEVERY ARMY IS COMPOSED OF LOWER GRADES OF THE SERVICETHE RANK ANDFILEOF WHOM THERE ARE ALWAYS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THE NEXT HIGHERMILITARY RANKCORPORALS AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS OF WHOM THERE AREFEWER AND OF STILLHIGHER OFFICERS OF WHOM THERE ARE STILL FEWER ANDSO ON TO THE HIGHEST MILITARY COMMAND WHICH IS CONCENTRATED IN ONEPERSONA MILITARY ORGANIZATION MAY BE QUITE CORRECTLY COMPARED TO A CONE OFWHICH THE BASE WITH THE LARGEST DIAMETER CONSISTS OF THE RANK AND FILETHE NEXT HIGHER AND SMALLER SECTION OF THE CONE CONSISTS OF THE NEXTHIGHER GRADES OF THE ARMY AND SO ON TO THE APEX THE POINT OF WHICHWILL REPRESENT THE COMMANDERINCHIEFTHE SOLDIERS OF WHOM THERE ARE THE MOST FORM THE LOWER SECTION OF THECONE AND ITS BASE THE SOLDIER HIMSELF DOES THE STABBING HACKINGBURNING AND PILLAGING AND ALWAYS RECEIVES ORDERS FOR THESE ACTIONSFROM MEN ABOVE HIM HE HIMSELF NEVER GIVES AN ORDER THE NONCOMMISSIONEDOFFICERS OF WHOM THERE ARE FEWER PERFORM THE ACTION ITSELF LESSFREQUENTLY THAN THE SOLDIERS BUT THEY ALREADY GIVE COMMANDS AN OFFICERSTILL LESS OFTEN ACTS DIRECTLY HIMSELF BUT COMMANDS STILL MOREFREQUENTLY A GENERAL DOES NOTHING BUT COMMAND THE TROOPS INDICATES THEOBJECTIVE AND HARDLY EVER USES A WEAPON HIMSELF THE COMMANDERINCHIEFNEVER TAKES DIRECT PART IN THE ACTION ITSELF BUT ONLY GIVES GENERALORDERS CONCERNING THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASS OF THE TROOPS A SIMILARRELATION OF PEOPLE TO ONE ANOTHER IS SEEN IN EVERY COMBINATION OF MENFOR COMMON ACTIVITYIN AGRICULTURE TRADE AND EVERY ADMINISTRATIONAND SO WITHOUT PARTICULARLY ANALYZING ALL THE CONTIGUOUS SECTIONS OF ACONE AND OF THE RANKS OF AN ARMY OR THE RANKS AND POSITIONS IN ANYADMINISTRATIVE OR PUBLIC BUSINESS WHATEVER FROM THE LOWEST TO THEHIGHEST WE SEE A LAW BY WHICH MEN TO TAKE ASSOCIATED ACTION COMBINEIN SUCH RELATIONS THAT THE MORE DIRECTLY THEY PARTICIPATE IN PERFORMINGTHE ACTION THE LESS THEY CAN COMMAND AND THE MORE NUMEROUS THEY AREWHILE THE LESS THEIR DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN THE ACTION ITSELF THE MORETHEY COMMAND AND THE FEWER OF THEM THERE ARE RISING IN THIS WAY FROMTHE LOWEST RANKS TO THE MAN AT THE TOP WHO TAKES THE LEAST DIRECT SHAREIN THE ACTION AND DIRECTS HIS ACTIVITY CHIEFLY TO COMMANDINGTHIS RELATION OF THE MEN WHO COMMAND TO THOSE THEY COMMAND IS WHATCONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THE CONCEPTION CALLED POWERHAVING RESTORED THE CONDITION OF TIME UNDER WHICH ALL EVENTS OCCUR WEFIND THAT A COMMAND IS EXECUTED ONLY WHEN IT IS RELATED TO ACORRESPONDING SERIES OF EVENTS RESTORING THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION OFRELATION BETWEEN THOSE WHO COMMAND AND THOSE WHO EXECUTE WE FIND THATBY THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE THOSE WHO COMMAND TAKE THE SMALLEST PARTIN THE ACTION ITSELF AND THAT THEIR ACTIVITY IS EXCLUSIVELY DIRECTED TOCOMMANDINGCHAPTER VIIWHEN AN EVENT IS TAKING PLACE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS AND WISHESABOUT IT AND AS THE EVENT RESULTS FROM THE COLLECTIVE ACTIVITY OF MANYPEOPLE SOME ONE OF THE OPINIONS OR WISHES EXPRESSED IS SURE TO BEFULFILLED IF BUT APPROXIMATELY WHEN ONE OF THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ISFULFILLED THAT OPINION GETS CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT AS A COMMANDPRECEDING ITMEN ARE HAULING A LOG EACH OF THEM EXPRESSES HIS OPINION AS TO HOW ANDWHERE TO HAUL IT THEY HAUL THE LOG AWAY AND IT HAPPENS THAT THIS ISDONE AS ONE OF THEM SAID HE ORDERED IT THERE WE HAVE COMMAND AND POWERIN THEIR PRIMARY FORM THE MAN WHO WORKED MOST WITH HIS HANDS COULD NOTTHINK SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING OR REFLECT ON OR COMMAND WHATWOULD RESULT FROM THE COMMON ACTIVITY WHILE THE MAN WHO COMMANDED MOREWOULD EVIDENTLY WORK LESS WITH HIS HANDS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GREATERVERBAL ACTIVITYWHEN SOME LARGER CONCOURSE OF MEN DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TO A COMMON AIMTHERE IS A YET SHARPER DIVISION OF THOSE WHO BECAUSE THEIR ACTIVITY ISGIVEN TO DIRECTING AND COMMANDING TAKE LESS PART IN THE DIRECT WORKWHEN A MAN WORKS ALONE HE ALWAYS HAS A CERTAIN SET OF REFLECTIONS WHICHAS IT SEEMS TO HIM DIRECTED HIS PAST ACTIVITY JUSTIFY HIS PRESENTACTIVITY AND GUIDE HIM IN PLANNING HIS FUTURE ACTIONS JUST THE SAME ISDONE BY A CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE ALLOWING THOSE WHO DO NOT TAKE A DIRECTPART IN THE ACTIVITY TO DEVISE CONSIDERATIONS JUSTIFICATIONS ANDSURMISES CONCERNING THEIR COLLECTIVE ACTIVITYFOR REASONS KNOWN OR UNKNOWN TO US THE FRENCH BEGAN TO DROWN AND KILLONE ANOTHER AND CORRESPONDING TO THE EVENT ITS JUSTIFICATION APPEARS INPEOPLES BELIEF THAT THIS WAS NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF FRANCE FORLIBERTY AND FOR EQUALITY PEOPLE CEASED TO KILL ONE ANOTHER AND THISEVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ITS JUSTIFICATION IN THE NECESSITY FOR ACENTRALIZATION OF POWER RESISTANCE TO EUROPE AND SO ON MEN WENT FROMTHE WEST TO THE EAST KILLING THEIR FELLOW MEN AND THE EVENT WASACCOMPANIED BY PHRASES ABOUT THE GLORY OF FRANCE THE BASENESS OFENGLAND AND SO ON HISTORY SHOWS US THAT THESE JUSTIFICATIONS OF THEEVENTS HAVE NO COMMON SENSE AND ARE ALL CONTRADICTORY AS IN THE CASE OFKILLING A MAN AS THE RESULT OF RECOGNIZING HIS RIGHTS AND THE KILLINGOF MILLIONS IN RUSSIA FOR THE HUMILIATION OF ENGLAND BUT THESEJUSTIFICATIONS HAVE A VERY NECESSARY SIGNIFICANCE IN THEIR OWN DAYTHESE JUSTIFICATIONS RELEASE THOSE WHO PRODUCE THE EVENTS FROM MORALRESPONSIBILITY THESE TEMPORARY AIMS ARE LIKE THE BROOM FIXED IN FRONTOF A LOCOMOTIVE TO CLEAR THE SNOW FROM THE RAILS IN FRONT THEY CLEARMENS MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THEIR PATHWITHOUT SUCH JUSTIFICATION THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY TO THE SIMPLESTQUESTION THAT PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN EXAMINING EACH HISTORICAL EVENT HOWIS IT THAT MILLIONS OF MEN COMMIT COLLECTIVE CRIMESMAKE WAR COMMITMURDER AND SO ONWITH THE PRESENT COMPLEX FORMS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE IN EUROPECAN ANY EVENT THAT IS NOT PRESCRIBED DECREED OR ORDERED BY MONARCHSMINISTERS PARLIAMENTS OR NEWSPAPERS BE IMAGINED IS THERE ANYCOLLECTIVE ACTION WHICH CANNOT FIND ITS JUSTIFICATION IN POLITICALUNITY IN PATRIOTISM IN THE BALANCE OF POWER OR IN CIVILIZATION SOTHAT EVERY EVENT THAT OCCURS INEVITABLY COINCIDES WITH SOME EXPRESSEDWISH AND RECEIVING A JUSTIFICATION PRESENTS ITSELF AS THE RESULT OFTHE WILL OF ONE MAN OR OF SEVERAL MENIN WHATEVER DIRECTION A SHIP MOVES THE FLOW OF THE WAVES IT CUTS WILLALWAYS BE NOTICEABLE AHEAD OF IT TO THOSE ON BOARD THE SHIP THEMOVEMENT OF THOSE WAVES WILL BE THE ONLY PERCEPTIBLE MOTIONONLY BY WATCHING CLOSELY MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF THAT FLOW ANDCOMPARING IT WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP DO WE CONVINCE OURSELVES THATEVERY BIT OF IT IS OCCASIONED BY THE FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP ANDTHAT WE WERE LED INTO ERROR BY THE FACT THAT WE OURSELVES WEREIMPERCEPTIBLY MOVINGWE SEE THE SAME IF WE WATCH MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF HISTORICALCHARACTERS THAT IS REESTABLISH THE INEVITABLE CONDITION OF ALL THATOCCURSTHE CONTINUITY OF MOVEMENT IN TIME AND DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THEESSENTIAL CONNECTION OF HISTORICAL PERSONS WITH THE MASSESWHEN THE SHIP MOVES IN ONE DIRECTION THERE IS ONE AND THE SAME WAVEAHEAD OF IT WHEN IT TURNS FREQUENTLY THE WAVE AHEAD OF IT ALSO TURNSFREQUENTLY BUT WHEREVER IT MAY TURN THERE ALWAYS WILL BE THE WAVEANTICIPATING ITS MOVEMENTWHATEVER HAPPENS IT ALWAYS APPEARS THAT JUST THAT EVENT WAS FORESEEN ANDDECREED WHEREVER THE SHIP MAY GO THE RUSH OF WATER WHICH NEITHERDIRECTS NOR INCREASES ITS MOVEMENT FOAMS AHEAD OF IT AND AT A DISTANCESEEMS TO US NOT MERELY TO MOVE OF ITSELF BUT TO GOVERN THE SHIPSMOVEMENT ALSOEXAMINING ONLY THOSE EXPRESSIONS OF THE WILL OF HISTORICAL PERSONSWHICH AS COMMANDS WERE RELATED TO EVENTS HISTORIANS HAVE ASSUMED THATTHE EVENTS DEPENDED ON THOSE COMMANDS BUT EXAMINING THE EVENTSTHEMSELVES AND THE CONNECTION IN WHICH THE HISTORICAL PERSONS STOOD TOTHE PEOPLE WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY AND THEIR ORDERS WERE DEPENDENT ONEVENTS THE INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF THIS DEDUCTION IS THAT HOWEVER MANYCOMMANDS WERE ISSUED THE EVENT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE UNLESS THERE AREOTHER CAUSES FOR IT BUT AS SOON AS AN EVENT OCCURSBE IT WHAT IT MAYTHEN OUT OF ALL THE CONTINUALLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF DIFFERENT PEOPLESOME WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND WHICH BY THEIR MEANING AND THEIR TIME OFUTTERANCE ARE RELATED AS COMMANDS TO THE EVENTSARRIVING AT THIS CONCLUSION WE CAN REPLY DIRECTLY AND POSITIVELY TOTHESE TWO ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS OF HISTORY WHAT IS POWER WHAT FORCE PRODUCES THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONS POWER IS THE RELATION OF A GIVEN PERSON TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS INWHICH THE MORE THIS PERSON EXPRESSES OPINIONS PREDICTIONS ANDJUSTIFICATIONS OF THE COLLECTIVE ACTION THAT IS PERFORMED THE LESS ISHIS PARTICIPATION IN THAT ACTION THE MOVEMENT OF NATIONS IS CAUSED NOT BY POWER NOR BY INTELLECTUALACTIVITY NOR EVEN BY A COMBINATION OF THE TWO AS HISTORIANS HAVESUPPOSED BUT BY THE ACTIVITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THEEVENTS AND WHO ALWAYS COMBINE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THOSE TAKING THELARGEST DIRECT SHARE IN THE EVENT TAKE ON THEMSELVES THE LEASTRESPONSIBILITY AND VICE VERSAMORALLY THE WIELDER OF POWER APPEARS TO CAUSE THE EVENT PHYSICALLY ITIS THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO THE POWER BUT AS THE MORAL ACTIVITY ISINCONCEIVABLE WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT IS NEITHER INTHE ONE NOR IN THE OTHER BUT IN THE UNION OF THE TWOOR IN OTHER WORDS THE CONCEPTION OF A CAUSE IS INAPPLICABLE TO THEPHENOMENA

DEALT ONLY WITH EXTERNAL PHENOMENA THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THISSIMPLE AND OBVIOUS LAW WOULD SUFFICE AND WE SHOULD HAVE FINISHED OURARGUMENT BUT THE LAW OF HISTORY RELATES TO MAN A PARTICLE OF

LAWTHE PRESENCE OF THE PROBLEM OF MANS FREE WILL THOUGH UNEXPRESSED ISFELT AT EVERY STEP OF HISTORYALL SERIOUSLY THINKING HISTORIANS HAVE INVOLUNTARILY ENCOUNTERED THISQUESTION ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS AND OBSCURITIES OF HISTORY AND THEFALSE PATH HISTORICAL SCIENCE HAS FOLLOWED ARE DUE SOLELY TO THE LACK OFA SOLUTION OF THAT QUESTIONIF THE WILL OF EVERY MAN WERE FREE THAT IS IF EACH MAN COULD ACT AS HEPLEASED ALL HISTORY WOULD BE A SERIES OF DISCONNECTED INCIDENTSIF IN A THOUSAND YEARS EVEN ONE MAN IN A MILLION COULD ACT FREELY THATIS AS HE CHOSE IT IS EVIDENT THAT ONE SINGLE FREE ACT OF THAT MANS INVIOLATION OF THE LAWS GOVERNING HUMAN ACTION WOULD DESTROY THEPOSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY LAWS FOR THE WHOLE OF HUMANITYIF THERE BE A SINGLE LAW GOVERNING THE ACTIONS OF MEN FREE WILL CANNOTEXIST FOR THEN MANS WILL IS SUBJECT TO THAT LAWIN THIS CONTRADICTION LIES THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL WHICH FROM MOSTANCIENT TIMES HAS OCCUPIED THE BEST HUMAN MINDS AND FROM MOST ANCIENTTIMES HAS BEEN PRESENTED IN ITS WHOLE TREMENDOUS SIGNIFICANCETHE PROBLEM IS THAT REGARDING MAN AS A SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION FROMWHATEVER POINT OF VIEWTHEOLOGICAL HISTORICAL ETHICAL ORPHILOSOPHICWE FIND A GENERAL LAW OF NECESSITY TO WHICH HE LIKE ALLTHAT EXISTS IS SUBJECT BUT REGARDING HIM FROM WITHIN OURSELVES AS WHATWE ARE CONSCIOUS OF WE FEEL OURSELVES TO BE FREETHIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SOURCE OF

EXIST IN OUR TIME THEMAJORITY OF SOCALLED ADVANCED PEOPLETHAT IS THE CROWD OFIGNORAMUSESHAVE TAKEN THE WORK OF THE NATURALISTS WHO DEAL WITH ONESIDE OF THE QUESTION FOR A SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEMTHEY SAY AND WRITE AND PRINT THAT THE SOUL AND FREEDOM DO NOT EXIST FORTHE LIFE OF MAN IS EXPRESSED BY MUSCULAR MOVEMENTS AND MUSCULARMOVEMENTS ARE CONDITIONED BY THE ACTIVITY OF THE NERVES THE SOUL ANDFREE WILL DO NOT EXIST BECAUSE AT AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME WE SPRANGFROM THE APES THEY SAY THIS NOT AT ALL SUSPECTING THAT THOUSANDS OFYEARS AGO THAT SAME LAW OF NECESSITY WHICH WITH SUCH ARDOR THEY ARE NOWTRYING TO PROVE BY PHYSIOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY WAS NOT MERELYACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL THE RELIGIONS AND ALL THE THINKERS BUT HAS NEVERBEEN DENIED THEY DO NOT SEE THAT THE ROLE OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES INTHIS MATTER IS MERELY TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE ILLUMINATION OFONE SIDE OF IT FOR THE FACT THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OFOBSERVATION REASON AND THE WILL ARE MERELY SECRETIONS OF THE BRAIN ANDTHAT MAN FOLLOWING THE GENERAL LAW MAY HAVE DEVELOPED FROM LOWER ANIMALSAT SOME UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME ONLY EXPLAINS FROM A FRESH SIDE THETRUTH ADMITTED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO BY ALL THE RELIGIOUS ANDPHILOSOPHIC THEORIESTHAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF REASON MAN ISSUBJECT TO THE LAW OF NECESSITY BUT IT DOES NOT ADVANCE BY A HAIRSBREADTH THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION WHICH HAS ANOTHER OPPOSITE SIDEBASED ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOMIF MEN DESCENDED FROM THE APES AT AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME THAT IS ASCOMPREHENSIBLE AS THAT THEY WERE MADE FROM A HANDFUL OF EARTH AT ACERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME IN THE FIRST CASE THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IS THETIME IN THE SECOND CASE IT IS THE ORIGIN AND THE QUESTION OF HOWMANS CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM IS TO BE RECONCILED WITH THE LAW OFNECESSITY TO WHICH HE IS SUBJECT CANNOT BE SOLVED BY COMPARATIVEPHYSIOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY FOR IN A FROG A RABBIT OR AN APE WE CANOBSERVE ONLY THE MUSCULAR NERVOUS ACTIVITY BUT IN MAN WE OBSERVECONSCIOUSNESS AS WELL AS THE MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS ACTIVITYTHE NATURALISTS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS THINKING THEY CAN SOLVE THISQUESTION ARE LIKE PLASTERERS SET TO PLASTER ONE SIDE OF THE WALLS OF ACHURCH WHO AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE ABSENCE OF THE CHIEFSUPERINTENDENT OF THE WORK SHOULD IN AN ACCESS OF ZEAL PLASTER OVER THEWINDOWS ICONS WOODWORK AND STILL UNBUTTRESSED WALLS AND SHOULD BEDELIGHTED THAT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW AS PLASTERERS EVERYTHING IS NOWSO SMOOTH AND REGULARCHAPTER IXFOR THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION OF FREE WILL OR INEVITABILITY HISTORYHAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH THEQUESTION IS DEALT WITH THAT FOR HISTORY THIS QUESTION DOES NOT REFER TOTHE ESSENCE OF MANS FREE WILL BUT ITS MANIFESTATION IN THE PAST ANDUNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONSIN REGARD TO THIS QUESTION HISTORY STANDS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES ASEXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE STANDS TO ABSTRACT SCIENCETHE SUBJECT FOR HISTORY IS NOT MANS WILL ITSELF BUT OUR PRESENTATION OFITAND SO FOR HISTORY THE INSOLUBLE MYSTERY PRESENTED BY THEINCOMPATIBILITY OF FREE WILL AND INEVITABILITY DOES NOT EXIST AS IT DOESFOR THEOLOGY ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY HISTORY SURVEYS A PRESENTATION OFMANS LIFE IN WHICH THE UNION OF THESE TWO CONTRADICTIONS HAS ALREADYTAKEN PLACEIN ACTUAL LIFE EACH HISTORIC EVENT EACH HUMAN ACTION IS VERY CLEARLYAND DEFINITELY UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF CONTRADICTION ALTHOUGHEACH EVENT PRESENTS ITSELF AS PARTLY FREE AND PARTLY COMPULSORYTO SOLVE THE QUESTION OF HOW FREEDOM AND NECESSITY ARE COMBINED AND WHATCONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS THE PHILOSOPHY OFHISTORY CAN AND SHOULD FOLLOW A PATH CONTRARY TO THAT TAKEN BY OTHERSCIENCES INSTEAD OF FIRST DEFINING THE CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM ANDINEVITABILITY IN THEMSELVES AND THEN RANGING THE PHENOMENA OF LIFEUNDER THOSE DEFINITIONS HISTORY SHOULD DEDUCE A DEFINITION OF THECONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND INEVITABILITY THEMSELVES FROM THE IMMENSEQUANTITY OF PHENOMENA OF WHICH IT IS COGNIZANT AND THAT ALWAYS APPEARDEPENDENT ON THESE TWO ELEMENTSWHATEVER PRESENTATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF MANY MEN OR OF AN INDIVIDUAL WEMAY CONSIDER WE ALWAYS REGARD IT AS THE RESULT PARTLY OF MANS

IN CHOOSING ONE DIRECTION OUT OF SEVERAL FOR HISWALK WE ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY CONTRADICTION THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM ANDINEVITABILITY GOVERNING THE ACTIONS OF THESE PEOPLE IS CLEARLY DEFINEDFOR USOUR CONCEPTION OF THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM OFTEN VARIES ACCORDING TODIFFERENCES IN THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH WE REGARD THE EVENT BUTEVERY HUMAN ACTION APPEARS TO US AS A CERTAIN COMBINATION OF FREEDOM ANDINEVITABILITY IN EVERY ACTION WE EXAMINE WE SEE A CERTAIN MEASURE OFFREEDOM AND A CERTAIN MEASURE OF INEVITABILITY AND ALWAYS THE MOREFREEDOM WE SEE IN ANY ACTION THE LESS INEVITABILITY DO WE PERCEIVE ANDTHE MORE INEVITABILITY THE LESS FREEDOMTHE PROPORTION OF FREEDOM TO INEVITABILITY DECREASES AND INCREASESACCORDING TO THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH THE ACTION IS REGARDED BUTTHEIR RELATION

FREE TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE MAN WAS HIMSELFDROWNING THAT THE MOTHER WAS HUNGRY THAT THE SOLDIER WAS IN THE RANKSAND SO ON SIMILARLY A MAN WHO COMMITTED A MURDER TWENTY YEARS AGO ANDHAS

CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM ANDNECESSITY IS INCREASED AND DIMINISHED DEPEND ON THREE CONSIDERATIONS THE RELATION TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD OF THE MAN WHO COMMITS THE DEEDS HIS RELATION TO TIME HIS RELATION TO THE CAUSES LEADING TO THE ACTIONTHE FIRST CONSIDERATION IS THE CLEARNESS OF OUR PERCEPTION OF THE MANSRELATION TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND THE GREATER OR LESSER CLEARNESS OFOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFINITE POSITION OCCUPIED BY THE MAN INRELATION TO EVERYTHING COEXISTING WITH HIM THIS IS WHAT MAKES ITEVIDENT THAT A DROWNING MAN IS LESS FREE AND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITYTHAN ONE STANDING ON DRY GROUND AND THAT MAKES THE ACTIONS OF A MANCLOSELY CONNECTED WITH OTHERS IN A THICKLY POPULATED DISTRICT OR OF ONEBOUND BY FAMILY OFFICIAL OR BUSINESS DUTIES SEEM CERTAINLY LESS FREEAND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITY THAN THOSE OF A MAN LIVING IN SOLITUDE ANDSECLUSIONIF WE CONSIDER A MAN ALONE APART FROM HIS RELATION TO EVERYTHING AROUNDHIM EACH ACTION OF HIS SEEMS TO US FREE BUT IF WE SEE HIS RELATION TOANYTHING AROUND HIM IF WE SEE HIS CONNECTION WITH ANYTHING WHATEVERWITH A MAN WHO SPEAKS TO HIM A BOOK HE READS THE WORK ON WHICH HE ISENGAGED EVEN WITH THE AIR HE BREATHES OR THE LIGHT THAT FALLS ON THETHINGS ABOUT HIMWE SEE THAT EACH OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAS ANINFLUENCE ON HIM AND CONTROLS AT LEAST SOME SIDE OF HIS ACTIVITY ANDTHE MORE WE PERCEIVE OF THESE INFLUENCES THE MORE OUR CONCEPTION OF HISFREEDOM DIMINISHES AND THE MORE OUR CONCEPTION OF THE NECESSITY THATWEIGHS ON HIM INCREASESTHE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS THE MORE OR LESS EVIDENT TIME RELATION OFTHE MAN TO THE WORLD AND THE CLEARNESS OF OUR PERCEPTION OF THE PLACETHE MANS ACTION OCCUPIES IN TIME THAT IS THE GROUND WHICH MAKES THEFALL OF THE FIRST MAN RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RACEAPPEAR EVIDENTLY LESS FREE THAN A MANS ENTRY INTO MARRIAGE TODAY IT ISTHE REASON WHY THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED CENTURIES AGOAND ARE CONNECTED WITH ME IN TIME CANNOT SEEM TO ME AS FREE AS THE LIFEOF A CONTEMPORARY THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN TO METHE DEGREE OF OUR CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM OR INEVITABILITY DEPENDS IN THISRESPECT ON THE GREATER OR LESSER LAPSE OF TIME BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCEOF THE ACTION AND OUR JUDGMENT OF ITIF I EXAMINE AN ACT I PERFORMED A MOMENT AGO IN APPROXIMATELY THE SAMECIRCUMSTANCES AS THOSE I AM IN NOW MY ACTION APPEARS TO ME UNDOUBTEDLYFREE BUT IF I EXAMINE AN ACT PERFORMED A MONTH AGO THEN BEING INDIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES I CANNOT HELP RECOGNIZING THAT IF THAT ACT HADNOT BEEN COMMITTED MUCH THAT RESULTED FROM ITGOOD AGREEABLE AND EVENESSENTIALWOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IF I REFLECT ON AN ACTION STILLMORE REMOTE TEN YEARS AGO OR MORE THEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONARE STILL PLAINER TO ME AND I FIND IT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED HAD THAT ACTION NOT BEEN PERFORMED THE FARTHER I GO BACK INMEMORY OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING THE FARTHER I GO FORWARD IN MYJUDGMENT THE MORE DOUBTFUL BECOMES MY BELIEF IN THE FREEDOM OF MYACTIONIN HISTORY WE FIND A VERY SIMILAR PROGRESS OF CONVICTION CONCERNING THEPART PLAYED BY FREE WILL IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF HUMANITY ACONTEMPORARY EVENT SEEMS TO US TO BE INDUBITABLY THE DOING OF ALL THEKNOWN PARTICIPANTS BUT WITH A MORE REMOTE EVENT WE ALREADY SEE ITSINEVITABLE RESULTS WHICH PREVENT OUR CONSIDERING ANYTHING ELSE POSSIBLEAND THE FARTHER WE GO BACK IN EXAMINING EVENTS THE LESS ARBITRARY DOTHEY APPEARTHE AUSTROPRUSSIAN WAR APPEARS TO US UNDOUBTEDLY THE RESULT OF THECRAFTY CONDUCT OF BISMARCK AND SO ON THE NAPOLEONIC WARS STILL SEEM TOUS THOUGH ALREADY QUESTIONABLY TO BE THE OUTCOME OF THEIR HEROESWILL BUT IN THE CRUSADES WE ALREADY SEE AN EVENT OCCUPYING ITS DEFINITEPLACE IN HISTORY AND WITHOUT WHICH WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE MODERN HISTORYOF EUROPE THOUGH TO THE CHRONICLERS OF THE CRUSADES THAT EVENT APPEAREDAS MERELY DUE TO THE WILL OF CERTAIN PEOPLE IN REGARD TO THE MIGRATIONOF THE PEOPLES IT DOES NOT ENTER ANYONES HEAD TODAY TO SUPPOSE THAT THERENOVATION OF THE EUROPEAN WORLD DEPENDED ON ATTILAS CAPRICE THEFARTHER BACK IN HISTORY THE OBJECT OF OUR OBSERVATION LIES THE MOREDOUBTFUL DOES THE FREE WILL OF THOSE CONCERNED IN THE EVENT BECOME ANDTHE MORE MANIFEST THE LAW OF INEVITABILITYTHE THIRD CONSIDERATION IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE APPREHEND THAT ENDLESSCHAIN OF CAUSATION INEVITABLY DEMANDED BY REASON IN WHICH EACHPHENOMENON COMPREHENDED AND THEREFORE MANS EVERY ACTION MUST HAVE ITSDEFINITE PLACE AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE AND AS A CAUSE OFWHAT WILL FOLLOWTHE BETTER WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ANDHISTORICAL LAWS DEDUCED BY OBSERVATION AND BY WHICH MAN IS CONTROLLEDAND THE MORE CORRECTLY WE PERCEIVE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ANDHISTORICAL CAUSES OF THE ACTION AND THE SIMPLER THE ACTION WE AREOBSERVING AND THE LESS COMPLEX THE CHARACTER AND MIND OF THE MAN INQUESTION THE MORE SUBJECT TO INEVITABILITY AND THE LESS FREE DO OURACTIONS AND THOSE OF OTHERS APPEARWHEN WE DO NOT AT ALL UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE OF AN ACTION WHETHER ACRIME A GOOD ACTION OR EVEN ONE THAT IS SIMPLY NONMORAL WE ASCRIBE AGREATER AMOUNT OF FREEDOM TO IT IN THE CASE OF A CRIME WE MOST URGENTLYDEMAND THE PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH AN ACT IN THE CASE OF A VIRTUOUS ACT WERATE ITS MERIT MOST HIGHLY IN AN INDIFFERENT CASE WE RECOGNIZE IN ITMORE INDIVIDUALITY ORIGINALITY AND INDEPENDENCE BUT IF EVEN ONE OFTHE INNUMERABLE CAUSES OF THE ACT IS KNOWN TO US WE RECOGNIZE A CERTAINELEMENT OF NECESSITY AND ARE LESS INSISTENT ON PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIMEOR THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE MERIT OF THE VIRTUOUS ACT OR THE FREEDOMOF THE APPARENTLY ORIGINAL ACTION THAT A CRIMINAL WAS REARED AMONG MALEFACTORS MITIGATES HIS FAULT IN OUR EYES THE SELFSACRIFICE OF A FATHEROR MOTHER OR SELFSACRIFICE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A REWARD IS MORECOMPREHENSIBLE THAN GRATUITOUS SELFSACRIFICE AND THEREFORE SEEMS LESSDESERVING OF SYMPATHY AND LESS THE RESULT OF FREE WILL THE FOUNDER OF ASECT OR PARTY OR AN INVENTOR IMPRESSES US LESS WHEN WE KNOW HOW OR BYWHAT THE WAY WAS PREPARED FOR HIS ACTIVITY IF WE HAVE A LARGE RANGE OFEXAMPLES IF OUR OBSERVATION IS CONSTANTLY DIRECTED TO SEEKING THECORRELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IN PEOPLES ACTIONS THEIR ACTIONSAPPEAR TO US MORE UNDER COMPULSION AND LESS FREE THE MORE CORRECTLY WECONNECT THE EFFECTS WITH THE CAUSES IF WE EXAMINED SIMPLE ACTIONS ANDHAD A VAST NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS UNDER OBSERVATION OUR CONCEPTION OFTHEIR INEVITABILITY WOULD BE STILL GREATER THE DISHONEST CONDUCT OF THESON OF A DISHONEST FATHER THE MISCONDUCT OF A WOMAN WHO HAD FALLEN INTOBAD COMPANY A DRUNKARDS RELAPSE INTO DRUNKENNESS AND SO ON AREACTIONS THAT SEEM TO US LESS FREE THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THEIR CAUSEIF THE MAN WHOSE ACTIONS WE ARE CONSIDERING IS ON A VERY LOW STAGE OFMENTAL DEVELOPMENT LIKE A CHILD A MADMAN OR A SIMPLETONTHENKNOWING THE CAUSES OF THE ACT AND THE SIMPLICITY OF THE CHARACTER ANDINTELLIGENCE IN QUESTION WE SEE SO LARGE AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY AND SOLITTLE FREE WILL THAT AS SOON AS WE KNOW THE CAUSE PROMPTING THE ACTIONWE CAN FORETELL THE RESULTON THESE THREE CONSIDERATIONS ALONE IS BASED THE CONCEPTION OFIRRESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIMES AND THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ADMITTEDBY ALL LEGISLATIVE CODES THE RESPONSIBILITY APPEARS GREATER OR LESSACCORDING TO OUR GREATER OR LESSER KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES INWHICH THE MAN WAS PLACED WHOSE ACTION IS BEING JUDGED AND ACCORDING TOTHE GREATER OR LESSER INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN THE COMMISSION OF THEACTION AND ITS INVESTIGATION AND ACCORDING TO THE GREATER OR LESSERUNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES THAT LED TO THE ACTIONCHAPTER XTHUS OUR CONCEPTION OF FREE WILL AND INEVITABILITY GRADUALLY DIMINISHESOR INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE GREATER OR LESSER CONNECTION WITH THEEXTERNAL WORLD THE GREATER OR LESSER REMOTENESS OF TIME AND THEGREATER OR LESSER DEPENDENCE ON THE CAUSES IN RELATION TO WHICH WECONTEMPLATE A MANS LIFESO THAT IF WE EXAMINE THE CASE OF A MAN WHOSE CONNECTION WITH THEEXTERNAL WORLD IS WELL KNOWN WHERE THE TIME BETWEEN THE ACTION AND ITSEXAMINATION IS GREAT AND WHERE THE CAUSES OF THE ACTION ARE MOSTACCESSIBLE WE GET THE CONCEPTION OF A MAXIMUM OF INEVITABILITY AND AMINIMUM OF FREE WILL IF WE EXAMINE A MAN LITTLE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNALCONDITIONS WHOSE ACTION WAS PERFORMED VERY RECENTLY AND THE CAUSES OFWHOSE ACTION ARE BEYOND OUR KEN WE GET THE CONCEPTION OF A MINIMUM OFINEVITABILITY AND A MAXIMUM OF FREEDOMIN NEITHER CASEHOWEVER WE MAY CHANGE OUR POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER PLAINWE MAY MAKE TO OURSELVES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE EXTERNALWORLD HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE IT MAY BE TO US HOWEVER LONG OR SHORT THEPERIOD OF TIME HOWEVER INTELLIGIBLE OR INCOMPREHENSIBLE THE CAUSES OFTHE ACTION MAY BECAN WE EVER CONCEIVE EITHER COMPLETE FREEDOM ORCOMPLETE NECESSITY TO WHATEVER DEGREE WE MAY IMAGINE A MAN TO BE EXEMPT FROM THEINFLUENCE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE NEVER GET A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM INSPACE EVERY HUMAN ACTION IS INEVITABLY CONDITIONED BY WHAT SURROUNDSHIM AND BY HIS OWN BODY I LIFT MY ARM AND LET IT FALL MY ACTION SEEMSTO ME FREE BUT ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I COULD RAISE MY ARM IN EVERYDIRECTION I SEE THAT I RAISED IT IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THERE WASLEAST OBSTRUCTION TO THAT ACTION EITHER FROM THINGS AROUND ME OR FROMTHE CONSTRUCTION OF MY OWN BODY I CHOSE ONE OUT OF ALL THE POSSIBLEDIRECTIONS BECAUSE IN IT THERE WERE FEWEST OBSTACLES FOR MY ACTION TOBE FREE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD ENCOUNTER NO OBSTACLES TOCONCEIVE OF A MAN BEING FREE WE MUST IMAGINE HIM OUTSIDE SPACE WHICH ISEVIDENTLY IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER MUCH WE APPROXIMATE THE TIME OF JUDGMENT TO THE TIME OF THEDEED WE NEVER GET A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM IN TIME FOR IF I EXAMINE ANACTION COMMITTED A SECOND AGO I MUST STILL RECOGNIZE IT AS NOT BEINGFREE FOR IT IS IRREVOCABLY LINKED TO THE MOMENT AT WHICH IT WASCOMMITTED CAN I LIFT MY ARM I LIFT IT BUT ASK MYSELF COULD I HAVEABSTAINED FROM LIFTING MY ARM AT THE MOMENT THAT HAS ALREADY PASSED TOCONVINCE MYSELF OF THIS I DO NOT LIFT IT THE NEXT MOMENT BUT I AM NOTNOW ABSTAINING FROM DOING SO AT THE FIRST MOMENT WHEN I ASKED THEQUESTION TIME HAS GONE BY WHICH I COULD NOT DETAIN THE ARM I THENLIFTED IS NO LONGER THE SAME AS THE ARM I NOW REFRAIN FROM LIFTING NORIS THE AIR IN WHICH I LIFTED IT THE SAME THAT NOW SURROUNDS ME THEMOMENT IN WHICH THE FIRST MOVEMENT WAS MADE IS IRREVOCABLE AND AT THATMOMENT I COULD MAKE ONLY ONE MOVEMENT AND WHATEVER MOVEMENT I MADEWOULD BE THE ONLY ONE THAT I DID NOT LIFT MY ARM A MOMENT LATER DOESNOT PROVE THAT I COULD HAVE ABSTAINED FROM LIFTING IT THEN AND SINCE ICOULD MAKE ONLY ONE MOVEMENT AT THAT SINGLE MOMENT OF TIME IT COULD NOTHAVE BEEN ANY OTHER TO IMAGINE IT AS FREE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMAGINEIT IN THE PRESENT ON THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURETHATIS OUTSIDE TIME WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER MUCH THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES MAY BEINCREASED WE NEVER REACH A CONCEPTION OF COMPLETE FREEDOM THAT IS ANABSENCE OF CAUSE HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE TO US MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THEEXPRESSION OF WILL IN ANY ACTION OUR OWN OR ANOTHERS THE FIRST DEMANDOF REASON IS THE ASSUMPTION OF AND SEARCH FOR A CAUSE FOR WITHOUT ACAUSE NO PHENOMENON IS CONCEIVABLE I RAISE MY ARM TO PERFORM AN ACTIONINDEPENDENTLY OF ANY CAUSE BUT MY WISH TO PERFORM AN ACTION WITHOUT ACAUSE IS THE CAUSE OF MY ACTIONBUT EVEN IFIMAGINING A MAN QUITE EXEMPT FROM ALL INFLUENCES EXAMININGONLY HIS MOMENTARY ACTION IN THE PRESENT UNEVOKED BY ANY CAUSEWE WERETO ADMIT SO INFINITELY SMALL A REMAINDER OF INEVITABILITY AS EQUALEDZERO WE SHOULD EVEN THEN NOT HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONCEPTION OF COMPLETEFREEDOM IN MAN FOR A BEING UNINFLUENCED BY THE EXTERNAL WORLD STANDINGOUTSIDE OF TIME AND INDEPENDENT OF CAUSE IS NO LONGER A MANIN THE SAME WAY WE CAN NEVER IMAGINE THE ACTION OF A MAN QUITE DEVOID OFFREEDOM AND ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY HOWEVER WE MAY INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS OF SPACE INWHICH MAN IS SITUATED THAT KNOWLEDGE CAN NEVER BE COMPLETE FOR THENUMBER OF THOSE CONDITIONS IS AS INFINITE AS THE INFINITY OF SPACE ANDTHEREFORE SO LONG AS NOT ALL THE CONDITIONS INFLUENCING MEN ARE DEFINEDTHERE IS NO COMPLETE INEVITABILITY BUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF FREEDOMREMAINS HOWEVER WE MAY PROLONG THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE ACTION WE AREEXAMINING AND THE JUDGMENT UPON IT THAT PERIOD WILL BE FINITE WHILETIME IS INFINITE AND SO IN THIS RESPECT TOO THERE CAN NEVER BE ABSOLUTEINEVITABILITY HOWEVER ACCESSIBLE MAY BE THE CHAIN OF CAUSATION OF ANY ACTION WESHALL NEVER KNOW THE WHOLE CHAIN SINCE IT IS ENDLESS AND SO AGAIN WENEVER REACH ABSOLUTE INEVITABILITYBUT BESIDES THIS EVEN IF ADMITTING THE REMAINING MINIMUM OF FREEDOM TOEQUAL ZERO WE ASSUMED IN SOME GIVEN CASEAS FOR INSTANCE IN THAT OF ADYING MAN AN UNBORN BABE OR AN IDIOTCOMPLETE ABSENCE OF FREEDOM BYSO DOING WE SHOULD DESTROY THE VERY CONCEPTION OF MAN IN THE CASE WE AREEXAMINING FOR AS SOON AS THERE IS NO FREEDOM THERE IS ALSO NO MAN ANDSO THE CONCEPTION OF THE ACTION OF A MAN SUBJECT SOLELY TO THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY WITHOUT ANY ELEMENT OF FREEDOM IS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE ASTHE CONCEPTION OF A MANS COMPLETELY FREE ACTIONAND SO TO IMAGINE THE ACTION OF A MAN ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY WITHOUT ANY FREEDOM WE MUST ASSUME THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANINFINITE NUMBER OF SPACE RELATIONS AN INFINITELY LONG PERIOD OF TIMEAND AN INFINITE SERIES OF CAUSESTO IMAGINE A MAN PERFECTLY FREE AND NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY WE MUST IMAGINE HIM ALL ALONE BEYOND SPACE BEYOND TIMEAND FREE FROM DEPENDENCE ON CAUSEIN THE FIRST CASE IF INEVITABILITY WERE POSSIBLE WITHOUT FREEDOM WESHOULD HAVE REACHED A DEFINITION OF INEVITABILITY BY THE LAWS OFINEVITABILITY ITSELF THAT IS A MERE FORM WITHOUT CONTENTIN THE SECOND CASE IF FREEDOM WERE POSSIBLE WITHOUT INEVITABILITY WESHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AT UNCONDITIONED FREEDOM BEYOND SPACE TIME ANDCAUSE WHICH BY THE FACT OF ITS BEING UNCONDITIONED AND UNLIMITED WOULDBE NOTHING OR MERE CONTENT WITHOUT FORMWE SHOULD

CONCEPTS WHICH IN THEIR UNION MUTUALLY DEFINE ONEANOTHER AS FORM AND CONTENT NO CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS POSSIBLEALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE LIFE OF MAN IS MERELY A CERTAIN RELATION OF FREEWILL TO INEVITABILITY THAT IS OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE LAWS OF REASONALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD OF NATURE IS ONLY A CERTAINRELATION OF THE FORCES OF NATURE TO INEVITABILITY OR OF THE ESSENCE OFLIFE TO THE LAWS OF REASONTHE GREAT NATURAL FORCES LIE OUTSIDE US AND WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OFTHEM WE CALL THOSE FORCES GRAVITATION INERTIA ELECTRICITY ANIMALFORCE AND SO ON BUT WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE

RECOGNIZEIT AS A FORCE NOT SUBJECT TO LAW THE EXISTENCE OF LAW BECOMESIMPOSSIBLEONLY BY REDUCING THIS ELEMENT OF FREE WILL TO THE INFINITESIMAL THATIS BY REGARDING IT AS AN INFINITELY SMALL QUANTITY CAN WE CONVINCEOURSELVES OF THE ABSOLUTE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE CAUSES AND THENINSTEAD OF SEEKING CAUSES HISTORY WILL TAKE THE DISCOVERY OF LAWS ASITS PROBLEMTHE SEARCH FOR THESE LAWS HAS LONG BEEN BEGUN AND THE NEW METHODS OFTHOUGHT WHICH HISTORY MUST ADOPT ARE BEING WORKED OUT SIMULTANEOUSLYWITH THE SELFDESTRUCTION TOWARD WHICHEVER DISSECTING AND DISSECTINGTHE CAUSES OF PHENOMENATHE OLD METHOD

ALONG THE SAME PATH OF REFLECTION THE OTHER SCIENCESHAVE PROCEEDED WHEN NEWTON ENUNCIATED THE LAW OF GRAVITY HE DID NOT SAYTHAT THE SUN OR THE EARTH HAD A PROPERTY OF ATTRACTION HE SAID THAT ALLBODIES

COMMON TO ALL THEINSEPARABLY INTERCONNECTED INFINITESIMAL ELEMENTS OF FREE WILLCHAPTER XIIFROM THE TIME THE LAW OF COPERNICUS WAS DISCOVERED AND PROVED THE MERERECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT THE SUN BUT THE EARTH THAT MOVESSUFFICED TO DESTROY THE WHOLE COSMOGRAPHY OF THE ANCIENTS BY DISPROVINGTHAT LAW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETAIN THE OLD CONCEPTION OF THEMOVEMENTS OF THE BODIES BUT WITHOUT DISPROVING IT IT WOULD SEEMIMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS BUT EVEN AFTER THEDISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS WERE STILLSTUDIED FOR A LONG TIMEFROM THE TIME THE FIRST PERSON SAID AND PROVED THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHSOR OF CRIMES IS SUBJECT TO MATHEMATICAL LAWS AND THAT THIS OR THAT MODEOF GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMICCONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCEMIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILTWERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCEBY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEENRETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUESTUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MANS FREE WILL FOR IF ACERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONS OFPEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHICETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THEN THE FREE WILL OF THOSEINDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT MODE OF GOVERNMENTOR OCCASIONED THE MIGRATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSEAND YET THE FORMER HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THELAWS OF STATISTICS GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL ECONOMY COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGYAND GEOLOGY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICT ITS ASSUMPTIONSTHE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OLD VIEWS AND THE NEW WAS LONG AND STUBBORNLYFOUGHT OUT IN PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THEOLOGY STOOD ON GUARD FOR THE OLDVIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION BUT WHEN TRUTHCONQUERED THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEWFOUNDATIONJUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEENTHE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAYSTANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF

THROUGH THE AGES ON THE OTHERIS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTIONTO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHYIT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH INGOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT AND IN THE MIRACLE OF JOSHUA THESON OF NUN TO THE DEFENDERS OF THE LAWS OF COPERNICUS AND NEWTON TOVOLTAIRE FOR EXAMPLE IT SEEMED THAT THE LAWS OF ASTRONOMY DESTROYEDRELIGION AND HE UTILIZED THE LAW OF GRAVITATION AS A WEAPON AGAINSTRELIGIONJUST SO IT NOW SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE ONLY TO ADMIT THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY TO DESTROY THE CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL OF GOOD AND EVILAND ALL THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AND CHURCH THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT UP ONTHOSE CONCEPTIONSSO TOO LIKE VOLTAIRE IN HIS TIME UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION THOUGHTHE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS INASTRONOMY FAR FROM DESTROYING EVEN STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICHTHE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AND CHURCH ARE ERECTEDAS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY NOWTHE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION ORNONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLEPHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY IT WAS THE IMMOVABILITY OF THE EARTH IN HISTORYIT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITYFREE WILLAS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTHLAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTHS FIXITY AND OFTHE MOTION OF THE PLANETS SO IN HISTORY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZINGTHE SUBJECTION OF PERSONALITY TO THE LAWS OF SPACE TIME AND CAUSE LIESIN RENOUNCING THE DIRECT FEELING OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF ONES OWNPERSONALITY BUT AS IN ASTRONOMY THE NEW VIEW SAID IT IS TRUE THAT WEDO NOT FEEL THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH BUT BY ADMITTING ITS IMMOBILITYWE ARRIVE AT ABSURDITY WHILE BY ADMITTING ITS MOTION WHICH WE DO NOTFEEL WE ARRIVE AT LAWS SO ALSO IN HISTORY THE NEW VIEW SAYS IT ISTRUE THAT WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF OUR DEPENDENCE BUT BY ADMITTING OURFREE WILL WE ARRIVE AT ABSURDITY WHILE BY ADMITTING OUR DEPENDENCE ONTHE EXTERNAL WORLD ON TIME AND ON CAUSE WE ARRIVE AT LAWSIN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANUNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEEL INTHE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE A FREEDOM THATDOES NOT EXIST AND TO
